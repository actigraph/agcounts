  abstract = {Purpose of Review: Digital technology affords the opportunity to provide objective, frequent, and sensitive assessment of disease outside of the clinic environment. This article reviews recent literature on the application of digital technology in movement disorders, with a focus on Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease. Recent Findings: Recent research has demonstrated the ability for digital technology to discriminate between individuals with and without PD, identify those at high risk for PD, quantify specific motor features, predict clinical events in PD, inform clinical management, and generate novel insights. Summary: Digital technology has enormous potential to transform clinical research and care in movement disorders. However, more work is needed to better validate existing digital measures, including in new populations, and to develop new more holistic digital measures that move beyond motor features.},

  abstract = {Background: In neurology and rehabilitation the primary interest for using wearables is to supplement traditional patient assessment and monitoring in hospital settings with continuous data collection at home and in community settings. The aim of this project was to develop a novel wearable garment with integrated sensors designed for continuous monitoring of physiological and movement related variables to evaluate progression, tailor treatments and improve diagnosis in epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and stroke. In this paper the early development and evaluation of a prototype designed to monitor movements and heart rate is described. An iterative development process and evaluation of an upper body garment with integrated sensors included: identification of user needs, specification of technical and garment requirements, garment development and production as well as evaluation of garment design, functionality and usability. The project is a multidisciplinary collaboration with experts from medical, engineering, textile, and material science within the wearITmed consortium. The work was organized in regular meetings, task groups and hands-on workshops. User needs were identified using results from a mixed-methods systematic review, a focus group study and expert groups. Usability was evaluated in 19 individuals (13 controls, 6 patients with Parkinson's disease) using semi-structured interviews and qualitative content analysis. Results: The garment was well accepted by the users regarding design and comfort, although the users were cautious about the technology and suggested improvements. All electronic components passed a washability test. The most robust data was obtained from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors while the electrodes for heart rate registration were sensitive to motion artefacts. The algorithm development within the wearITmed consortium has shown promising results. Conclusions: The prototype was accepted by the users. Technical improvements are needed, but preliminary data indicate that the garment has potential to be used as a tool for diagnosis and treatment selection and could provide added value for monitoring seizures in epilepsy, fluctuations in PD and activity levels in stroke. Future work aims to improve the prototype further, develop algorithms, and evaluate the functionality and usability in targeted patient groups. The potential of incorporating blood pressure and heart-rate variability monitoring will also be explored.},

However, the potential and limitations of these devices remain less well quantified. Addressing this issue, we aim at providing a comprehensive analysis of the impact of accelerometer, autonomic nervous system (ANS)-mediated peripheral signals, and circadian features for sleep stage detection on a large dataset. Four hundred and forty nights from 106 individuals, for a total of 3444 h of combined polysomnography (PSG) and physiological data from a wearable ring, were acquired. Features were extracted to investigate the relative impact of different data streams on 2-stage (sleep and wake) and 4-stage classification accuracy (light NREM sleep, deep NREM sleep, REM sleep, and wake). Machine learning models were evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation and a standardized framework for sleep stage classification assessment. Accuracy for 2-stage detection (sleep, wake) was 94\% for a simple accelerometer-based model and 96\% for a full model that included ANS-derived and circadian features. Accuracy for 4-stage detection was 57\% for the accelerometer-based model and 79\% when including ANS-derived and circadian features. Combining the compact form factor of a finger ring, multidimensional biometric sensory streams, and machine learning, high accuracy wake-sleep detection and sleep staging can be accomplished.},

The detection of rhythmic movement components, such as the clonic part of tonic\textendash clonic seizures, is essential in all seizure detection based on movement sensors. Of the many available movement sensor types, accelerometric sensors are used most often. Eleven video-electroencephalographic (EEG) and 1 field study have been carried out. The results of these clinical trials depend on the population, study design, and seizure evolution. In video-EEG monitoring units, sensitivity for tonic\textendash clonic seizures varied from 31\% to 95\%, and positive predictive value from 4\% to 60\%. In a field trial in a residential adult population with intellectual disability, sensitivity was 14\% and positive predictive value was 82\%, whereas in patients admitted to an epilepsy clinic, a bed sensor had a sensitivity of 84\% (no positive predictive value was given). The algorithms using the ``rhythmic movement'' component at the end of a tonic\textendash clonic seizure are reliable (few false-positive alarms) but miss less typical seizure patterns that are mostly present in people with associated brain development disturbances. Other modalities (heart rate and electromyography) are needed to increase the detection performance. Advanced accelerometric techniques allow us to gain greater insight into seizure evolution patterns, possibilities for neuromodulation, and the influence of antiepileptic drugs on specific seizure components.},

  abstract = {Accelerometers have been widely deployed in public health studies in recent years. While they collect high-resolution acceleration signals (e.g., 10\textendash 100 Hz), research has mainly focused on summarized metrics provided by accelerometers manufactures, such as the activity count (AC) by ActiGraph or Actical. Such measures do not have a publicly available formula, lack a straightforward interpretation, and can vary by software implementation or hardware type. To address these problems, we propose the physical activity index (AI), a new metric for summarizing raw tri-axial accelerometry data. We compared this metric with the AC and another recently proposed metric for raw data, Euclidean Norm Minus One (ENMO), against energy expenditure. The comparison was conducted using data from the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health Study, in which 194 women 60\textendash 91 years performed 9 lifestyle activities in the laboratory, wearing a tri-axial accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+) on the hip set to 30 Hz and an Oxycon portable calorimeter, to record both tri-axial acceleration time series (converted into AI, AC, and ENMO) and oxygen uptake during each activity (converted into metabolic equivalents (METs)) at the same time. Receiver operating characteristic analyses indicated that both AI and ENMO were more sensitive to moderate and vigorous physical activities than AC, while AI was more sensitive to sedentary and light activities than ENMO. AI had the highest coefficients of determination for METs (0.72) and was a better classifier of physical activity intensity than both AC (for all intensity levels) and ENMO (for sedentary and light intensity). The proposed AI provides a novel and transparent way to summarize densely sampled raw accelerometry data, and may serve as an alternative to AC. The AI's largely improved sensitivity on sedentary and light activities over AC and ENMO further demonstrate its advantage in studies with older adults.},

  abstract = {An individual's physical activity substantially impacts the potential for prevention and recovery from diverse health issues, including cardiovascular diseases. Precise quantification of a patient's level of day-to-day physical activity, which can be characterized by the type, intensity, and duration of movement, is crucial for clinicians. Walking is a primary and fundamental physical activity for most individuals. Walking speed has been shown to correlate with various heart pathologies and overall function. As such, it is often used as a metric to assess health performance. A range of clinical walking tests exist to evaluate gait and inform clinical decision-making. However, these assessments are often short, provide qualitative movement assessments, and are performed in a clinical setting that is not representative of the real-world. Technological advancements in wearable sensing and associated algorithms enable new opportunities to complement in-clinic evaluations of movement during free-living. However, the use of wearable devices to inform clinical decisions presents several challenges, including lack of subject compliance and limited sensor battery life. To bridge the gap between free-living and clinical environments, we propose an approach in which we utilize different wearable sensors at different temporal scales and resolutions. Here, we present a method to accurately estimate gait speed in the free-living environment from a low-power, lightweight accelerometer-based bio-logging tag secured on the thigh. We use high-resolution measurements of gait kinematics to build subject-specific data-driven models to accurately map stride frequencies extracted from the bio-logging system to stride speeds. The model-based estimates of stride speed were evaluated using a long outdoor walk and compared to stride parameters calculated from a foot-worn inertial measurement unit using the zero-velocity update algorithm. The proposed method presents an average concordance correlation coefficient of 0.80 for all subjects, and 97\% of the error is within {$\pm$}0.2m {$\cdot$} s-1. The approach presented here provides promising results that can enable clinicians to complement their existing assessments of activity level and fitness with measurements of movement duration and intensity (walking speed) extracted at a week time scale and in the patients' free-living environment.},

In addition, we aimed to remove the ambiguity found in the literature of the definition of the initial contact (IC) from the lumbar accelerometer. Acceleration and angular velocity data was gathered from the lumbar region and the distal edge of each shank. This data was evaluated in comparison to an instrumented treadmill and an optoelectronic system during five treadmill speed sessions. Results: The lumbar accelerometer showed that the peak of the anteroposterior component was the most accurate for IC detection. Similarly, the valley that followed the peak of the vertical component was the most precise for terminal contact (TC) detection. Results based on ANOVA and Tukey tests showed that the set of inertial methods was suitable for temporal gait assessment and gait event detection in able-bodied subjects. For gait event detection, an exception was found with the shank accelerometer. The tool was suitable for temporal parameters assessment, despite the high root mean square error on the detection of IC (RMSEIC) and TC (RMSETC). The shank gyroscope was found to be as accurate as the kinematic method since the statistical tests revealed no significant difference between the two techniques for the RMSE off all gait events and temporal parameters. Conclusion: The lumbar and shank accelerometers were the most accurate alternative to the shank gyroscope for gait event detection and temporal parameters assessment, respectively.},

Seventy-three consecutive patients (age 6\textendash 68 years; median 37 years) at risk of having GTCS and who were admitted to the long-term video\textendash electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring unit (LTM) were recruited in three centers. The reference standard was considered the seizure time points identified by experienced clinical neurophysiologists, based on the video-EEG recordings and blinded to the accelerometer sensor data. Seizure time points detected real-time by the sensor were compared with the reference standard. Patients were monitored for 17\textendash 171 h (mean 66.8; total 4,878). Thirty-nine GTCS were recorded in 20 patients. The device detected 35 seizures (89.7\%). In 16 patients all seizures were detected. In three patients more than two thirds of the seizures were detected. The mean of the sensitivity calculated for each patient was 91\%. The mean detection latency measured from the start of the focal seizure preceding the secondarily GTCS was 55 s (95\% confidence interval [CI] 38\textendash 73 s). The rate of false alarms was 0.2/day. Our results suggest that the wireless wrist accelerometer sensor detects GTCS with high sensitivity and specificity. Patients with GTCS have an increased risk for injuries related to seizures and for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), and many nocturnal seizures remain undetected in unattended patients. A portable automatic seizure detection device will be an important tool for helping these patients.},

METHODS: Adult patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) wore pedometers and completed PRO assessments during transplant hospitalization (4 weeks) and 4 weeks post-discharge. Patient reports of symptomatic treatment toxicities (single items from PRO-CTCAE, http://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/pro-ctcae ) and symptoms, physical health, mental health, and quality of life (PROMIS(\textregistered ) Global-10, http://nih.promis.org ), assessed weekly with 7-day recall on Likert scales, were compared individually with pedometry data, summarized as average daily steps per week, using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients [mean age 55 (SD = 14), 63 \% male, 84 \% white, 56 \% autologous, 43 \% allogeneic] completed a mean 4.6 (SD = 1.5, range 1-8) evaluable assessments. Regression model coefficients ({$\beta$}) indicated within-person decrements in average daily steps were associated with increases in pain ({$\beta$} = -852; 852 fewer steps per unit increase in pain score, p {$<$} 0.001), fatigue ({$\beta$} = -886, p {$<$} 0.001), vomiting ({$\beta$} = -518, p {$<$} 0.01), shaking/chills ({$\beta$} = -587, p {$<$} 0.01), diarrhea ({$\beta$} = -719, p {$<$} 0.001), shortness of breath ({$\beta$} = -1018, p {$<$} 0.05), reduction in carrying out social activities ({$\beta$} = 705, p {$<$} 0.01) or physical activities ({$\beta$} = 618, p {$<$} 0.01), and global physical health ({$\beta$} = 101, p {$<$} 0.001), but not global mental health or quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: In this small sample of HCT recipients, more severe symptoms, impaired physical health, and restrictions in the performance of usual daily activities were associated with statistically significant decrements in objectively measured daily steps.

Additionally, the effect of the low frequency extension filter (LFEF) on the step accuracy was determined. Thirty healthy individuals walked straight and walked with continuous turns in different gait speeds. Number of steps were recorded with a hip and ankle worn AG, and with a Stepwatch (SW) activity monitor positioned around the right ankle, which was used as a reference for step count. The percentage agreement, interclass correlation coefficients and Bland\textendash Altmann plots were determined between the AG and the reference SW across gait speeds for the two walking conditions. The ankle worn AG with the default filter was the most sensitive for step detection at {$>$}0.6 m/s, whilst accurate step detection for gait speeds {$<$} 0.6 m/s were only observed when applying the LFEF. The hip worn AG with the default filter showed poor accuracy (12\textendash 78\%) at gait speeds {$<$} 1.0 m/s whereas the accuracy increased to {$>$}87\% for gait speeds {$<$} 1.0 m/s when applying the LFEF. Ankle worn AG was the most sensitive to measure steps at a vast range of gait speeds.

  abstract = {ActiGraph acceleration data are processed through several steps (including band-pass filtering to attenuate unwanted signal frequencies) to generate the activity counts commonly used in physical activity research. We performed three experiments to investigate the effect of sampling frequency on the generation of activity counts. Ideal acceleration signals were produced in the MATLAB software. Thereafter, ActiGraph GT3X+ monitors were spun in a mechanical setup. Finally, 20 subjects performed walking and running wearing GT3X+ monitors. Acceleration data from all experiments were collected with different sampling frequencies, and activity counts were generated with the ActiLife software. With the default 30-Hz (or 60-Hz, 90-Hz) sampling frequency, the generation of activity counts was performed as intended with 50\% attenuation of acceleration signals with a frequency of 2.5 Hz by the signal frequency band-pass filter. Frequencies above 5 Hz were eliminated totally. However, with other sampling frequencies, acceleration signals above 5 Hz escaped the band-pass filter to a varied degree and contributed to additional activity counts. Similar results were found for the spinning of the GT3X+ monitors, although the amount of activity counts generated was less, indicating that raw data stored in the GT3X+ monitor is processed. Between 600 and 1,600 more counts per minute were generated with the sampling frequencies 40 and 100 Hz compared with 30 Hz during running. Sampling frequency affects the processing of ActiGraph acceleration data to activity counts. Researchers need to be aware of this error when selecting sampling frequencies other than the default 30 Hz.},

Youth with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) appear to participate in less PA compared to nonsyndromal children, likely due to syndrome-related factors. However, description of PA patterns in youth with PWS is lacking. The purpose of this study was to characterize PA in youth with PWS and to compare it to PA in children with nonsyndromal obesity. Twenty-four youth with PWS (ages 8\textendash 16 years) and 40 obese children without PWS (OB) (ages 8\textendash 11 years) wore accelerometers for eight consecutive days. Data were screened for compliance and classified into PA intensities: sedentary behavior (SED), light (LPA), moderate (MPA), vigorous (VPA) and moderate plus vigorous (MVPA). Youth with PWS spent 19.4\% less time in weekly LPA (p = 0.007) and 29.8\% less time in weekly VPA compared to OB controls (p = 0.036). All other intensities were similar between groups. In addition, PWS participated in less LPA and VPA during the weekends compared to OB, and less LPA on weekdays when compared to OB. There was also a trend towards PWS participating in less MVPA during the weekends and less VPA during the weekends than OB controls. There was a trend towards PWS participating in less VPA on weekends compared to weekdays, while OB participated similarly in VPA on weekdays and weekend days. On average, neither PWS nor OB children met minimum MVPA recommendations. The results suggest there is a need to design exercise programs for PWS youth that focus on integrating vigorous intensity activities, especially during the weekends when structured PA may not be available.},

Free-living physical activity and estimated free-living EE are measured using portable triaxial accelerometers individually calibrated in each subject during their stay in the AEMS. Results Representative data from two PWS patients and two matched control (CTR) subjects displayed EE during their inactive lifestyles.

Studies were included if they reported on the measurement properties of self-administered and proxy-reported PA questionnaires in youth (mean age {$<$}18 years) and were published in the English language. Methodological quality and results of included studies was appraised using a standardized checklist (qualitative attributes and measurement properties of PA questionnaires [QAPAQ]). We included 54 manuscripts examining 61 versions of questionnaires. None of the included questionnaires showed both acceptable reliability and validity. Only seven questionnaires received a positive rating for reliability. Reported validity varied, with correlations between PA questionnaires and accelerometers ranging from very low to high (previous day PA recall: correlation coefficient [r] = 0.77). In general, PA questionnaires for adolescents correlated better with accelerometer scores than did those for children. From this systematic review, we conclude that no questionnaires were available with both acceptable reliability and validity. Considerably more high-quality research is required to examine the validity and reliability of promising PA questionnaires for youth.},

  abstract = {Pathological proteins contributing to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are known to disrupt normal neuronal functions in the brain, leading to unbalanced neuronal excitatory-inhibitory tone, distorted neuronal synchrony, and network oscillations. However, it has been proposed that abnormalities in neuronal activity directly contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease, and in fact it has been demonstrated that induction of synchronized 40 Hz gamma oscillation of neuronal networks by sensory stimulation reverses AD-related pathological markers in transgenic mice carrying AD-related human pathological genes. Based on these findings, the current study evaluated whether non-invasive sensory stimulation inducing cortical 40 Hz gamma oscillation is clinically beneficial for AD patients. Patients with mild to moderate AD (               n               = 22) were randomized to active treatment group (               n               = 14; gamma sensory stimulation therapy) or to sham group (               n               = 8). Participants in the active treatment group received precisely timed, 40 Hz visual and auditory stimulations during eye-closed condition to induce cortical 40 Hz steady-state oscillations in 1-h daily sessions over a 6-month period. Participants in the sham group were exposed to similar sensory stimulation designed to not evoke cortical 40 Hz steady-state oscillations that are observed in the active treatment patients. During the trial, nighttime activities of the patients were monitored with continuous actigraphy recordings, and their functional abilities were measured by Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study \textendash{} Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale. Results of this study demonstrated that 1-h daily therapy was well tolerated throughout the 6-month treatment period by all subjects. Patients receiving gamma sensory stimulation showed significantly reduced nighttime active periods, in contrast, to deterioration in sleep quality in sham group patients. Patients in the sham group also showed the expected, significant decline in ADCS-ADL scores, whereas patients in the gamma sensory stimulation group fully maintained their functional abilities over the 6-month period. These findings confirm the safe application of 40 Hz sensory stimulation in AD patients and demonstrate a high adherence to daily treatment. Furthermore, this is the first time that beneficial clinical effects of the therapy are reported, justifying expanded and longer trials to explore additional clinical benefits and disease-modifying properties of gamma sensory stimulation therapy.

  abstract = {Wrist-worn devices, such as smartwatches and smart bands, have brought about the unprecedented opportunity to continuously monitor gait during daily routines. However, the use of a single wrist-worn unit for gait analysis is challenging for a variety of reasons. Indeed, the signal collected at the user's wrist is subject to a significant ``noise'' with respect to other body positions (e.g. waist), mainly due to the arm swing while walking and other unpredictable hand movements. The aim of this paper is to investigate the design and evaluation of a lightweight and reliable gait detection technique for wrist-worn devices. To this end, the proposed method creates a personalized model of the user's gait patterns. The model is created through an automatic training phase, which requires the temporary use of an additional device (smartphone) to gather true gait segments. After, anomaly detection is used to distinguish gait from other activities. Gait data from 20 volunteers have been collected to test and evaluate the proposed technique. Volunteers were asked to walk at different pace, with their normal arm swing or placing the hand inside of a pocket. Results show that the proposed method can reliably distinguish gait from spurious hand movements.},

Basing on literature available results, neither a standard protocol for validation nor fixed metrological characteristics can be identified. Wearable devices are validated without standard procedures (test protocol, population characteristics and metrological parameters), which turns into irregular results, barely comparable each other. Therefore, it would be extremely interesting to conduct a pilot study to identify standard characteristics to evaluate accuracy, compliant to the guidelines for the expression of uncertainty in measurement and recognized by organizations promoting public health (e.g. the Food and Drug Administration in the United States). This way, it would be possible to start establishing a database of wearable devices' metrological properties, useful not only for research, but also for caregivers and sportsmen, in different application fields (e.g. sport, medicine, Active and Assisted Living, etc.).},

The ability to collect continuous activity monitoring data with digital devices in real-world environments has opened unprecedented opportunity to establish clinical digital phenotypes across diseases. Many traditional assessments of physical function utilized in clinical trials are limited because they are episodic, therefore, cannot capture the day-to-day temporal fluctuations and longitudinal changes in activity that individuals experience. In order to understand the sensitivity of gait speed as a potential endpoint for clinical trials, we investigated the use of digital devices during traditional clinical assessments and in real-world environments in a group of healthy younger (               n               \,=\,33, 18\textendash 40 years) and older (               n               \,=\,32, 65\textendash 85 years) adults. We observed good agreement between gait speed estimated using a lumbar-mounted accelerometer and gold standard system during the performance of traditional gait assessment task in-lab, and saw discrepancies between in-lab and at-home gait speed. We found that gait speed estimated in-lab, with or without digital devices, failed to differentiate between the age groups, whereas gait speed derived during at-home monitoring was able to distinguish the age groups. Furthermore, we found that only three days of at-home monitoring was sufficient to reliably estimate gait speed in our population, and still capture age-related group differences. Our results suggest that gait speed derived from activities during daily life using data from wearable devices may have the potential to transform clinical trials by non-invasively and unobtrusively providing a more objective and naturalistic measure of functional ability.},

Using accelerometer-based kinematic sensors, data were gathered from subjects undergoing medication titration at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Over the course of the study, subjects repeatedly performed a predefined set of instrumental activities of daily living (iADLs). During the monitoring sessions, EEG and video data were also recorded and provided the gold standard for seizure detection. To distinguish seizure events from iADLs, we developed a template matching algorithm. Considering the unique signature of seizure events and the inherent temporal variability of seizure types across subjects, we incorporated a customized mass\textendash spring template into the dynamic time warping algorithm. We then ported this algorithm onto a commercially available internet tablet and developed our body sensor network on the Mercury platform. We designed several policies on this platform to compare the tradeoffs between feature calculation, raw data transmission, and battery lifetime. From a dataset of 21 seizures, the sensitivity for our template matching algorithm was found to be 0.91 and specificity of 0.84. We achieved a battery lifetime of 10.5 h on the Mercury platform.},

Therefore, this study compared measured physical activity, using an Actigraph Link, between the preferred and non-preferred wrist during college students' structured daily college activities and free-living conditions. 30 participants completed 7 lab tasks wearing an accelerometer on each wrist followed by 7~days of free-living data. Average vector magnitude (AVM) of counts per minute during lab activities and free-living conditions were compared between the preferred and non-preferred wrists. AVM was significantly higher in the preferred wrist compared to the non-preferred during basketball (preferred\,=\,22,753.9 (SD 4,013.6) vs non-preferred\,=\,20,655.6 (3,196.5), p\,=\,.003), and racquetball (15,248.4 (3,503.9) vs 12,030.0 (3,115.6), p\,{$<$}\,.001).

  abstract = {The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and related mobility issues places a serious burden on healthcare systems. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the urgent need for better tools to manage chronic conditions remotely, as regular access to clinics may be problematic. Digital health technology in the form of remote monitoring with body-worn sensors offers significant opportunities for transforming research and revolutionizing the clinical management of PD. Significant efforts are being invested in the development and validation of digital outcomes to support diagnosis and track motor and mobility impairments ``off-line''. Imagine being able to remotely assess your patient, understand how well they are functioning, evaluate the impact of any recent medication/intervention, and identify the need for urgent follow-up before overt, irreparable change takes place? This could offer new pragmatic solutions for personalized care and clinical research. So the question remains: how close are we to achieving this? Here, we describe the state-of-the-art based on representative papers published between 2017 and 2020. We focus on remote (i.e., real-world, daily-living) monitoring of PD using body-worn sensors (e.g., accelerometers, inertial measurement units) for assessing motor symptoms and their complications. Despite the tremendous potential, existing challenges exist (e.g., validity, regulatory) that are preventing the widespread clinical adoption of body-worn sensors as a digital outcome. We propose a roadmap with clear recommendations for addressing these challenges and future directions to bring us closer to the implementation and widespread adoption of this important way of improving the clinical care, evaluation, and monitoring of PD.},

  abstract = {Patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) frequently report pain, stiffness, fatigue, and sleep problems, which may lead to impaired physical activity. The majority of reported-on measures evaluating physical activity and sleep disturbance in axSpA are self-reported questionnaires, which can be impacted by patient recall (reporting bias). One objective measure, polysomnography, has been employed to evaluate sleep in patients with axSpA; however, it is an intrusive measure and cannot be used over the long term. More convenient objective measures are therefore needed to allow for the long-term assessment of both sleep and physical activity in patients' daily lives. Wearable technology that utilizes actigraphy is increasingly being used for the objective measurement of physical activity and sleep in various therapy areas, as it is unintrusive and suitable for continuous tracking to allow longitudinal assessment. Actigraphy characterizes sleep disruption as restless movement while sleeping, which is particularly useful when studying conditions such as axSpA in which chronic pain and discomfort due to stiffness may be evident. Studies have also shown that actigraphy can effectively assess the impact of disease on physical activity. More research is needed to establish the usefulness of objective monitoring of sleep and physical activity specifically in axSpA patients over time. This review summarizes the current perspectives on physical activity and sleep quality in patients with axSpA, and the possible role of actigraphy in the future to more accurately evaluate the impact of treatment interventions on sleep and physical activity in axSpA.Funding: Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.Plain Language Summary: Plain language summary available for this article.},

Misdiagnosis among tremor syndromes is common, and can impact on both clinical care and research. To date no validated neurophysiological technique is available that has proven to have good classification performance, and the diagnostic gold standard is the clinical evaluation made by a movement disorders expert. We present a robust new neurophysiological measure, the tremor stability index, which can discriminate Parkinson's disease tremor and essential tremor with high diagnostic accuracy. The tremor stability index is derived from kinematic measurements of tremulous activity. It was assessed in a test cohort comprising 16 rest tremor recordings in tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease and 20 postural tremor recordings in essential tremor, and validated on a second, independent cohort comprising a further 55 tremulous Parkinson's disease and essential tremor recordings. Clinical diagnosis was used as gold standard. One hundred seconds of tremor recording were selected for analysis in each patient. The classification accuracy of the new index was assessed by binary logistic regression and by receiver operating characteristic analysis. The diagnostic performance was examined by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, likelihood ratio positive, likelihood ratio negative, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and by cross-validation. Tremor stability index with a cut-off of 1.05 gave good classification performance for Parkinson's disease tremor and essential tremor, in both test and validation datasets. Tremor stability index maximum sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 95\%, 95\% and 92\%, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.916 (95\% confidence interval 0.797\textendash 1.000) for the test dataset and a value of 0.855 (95\% confidence interval 0.754\textendash 0.957) for the validation dataset. Classification accuracy proved independent of recording device and posture. The tremor stability index can aid in the differential diagnosis of the two most common tremor types. It has a high diagnostic accuracy, can be derived from short, cheap, widely available and non-invasive tremor recordings, and is independent of operator or postural context in its interpretation.},

METHODS: 65 nights of data from 13 adult participants was collected while participants wore two actigraphy devices, one on each wrist. Sleep indices including total sleep time (TST), total time in bed (TTB), sleep efficiency (SE\%), sleep latency (SL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep onset time (SOT) and wake time (WT) were assessed between the two devices. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between devices for any of the measured sleep variables (p{$>$}0.05). SE\%, SL and WASO resulted in high correlations between devices (0.89, 0.89 and 0.76, respectively), with all other sleep variables resulting in very high correlations ({$>$}0.90) between devices. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, it does not seem critical which wrist the actigraphy device is worn on for measuring key sleep variables.},

  abstract = {Background: Objective measures using accelerometer-based activity monitors have been extensively used in physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) research. To measure PA and SB precisely, the field is shifting towards machine learning-based (ML) approaches for calibration and validation of accelerometer-based activity monitors. Nevertheless, various parameters regarding the use and development of ML-based models, including data type (raw acceleration data versus activity counts), sampling frequency, window size, input features, ML technique, accelerometer placement, and free-living settings, affect the predictive ability of ML-based models. The effects of these parameters on ML-based models have remained elusive, and will be systematically reviewed here. The open challenges were identified and recommendations are made for future studies and directions. Method: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed and Scopus databases to identify studies published before July 2017 that used ML-based techniques for calibration and validation of accelerometer-based activity monitors. Additional articles were manually identified from references in the identified articles. Results: A total of 62 studies were eligible to be included in the review, comprising 48 studies that calibrated and validated ML-based models for predicting the type and intensity of activities, and 22 studies for predicting activity energy expenditure. Conclusions: It appears that various ML-based techniques together with raw acceleration data sampled at 20\textendash 30 Hz provide the opportunity of predicting the type and intensity of activities, as well as activity energy expenditure with comparable overall predictive accuracies regardless of accelerometer placement. However, the high predictive accuracy of laboratory-calibrated models is not reproducible in free-living settings, due to transitive and unseen activities together with differences in acceleration signals.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have established the usefulness of pedometers and accelerometers as objective activity monitors. Under laboratory conditions, some of these devices have been shown to provide accurate and reliable measures of steps. However, limited data exist on the performance of these devices under free-living conditions. PURPOSE: This study aimed 1) to compare the effects of speed and body mass index (BMI) on the step count accuracy of five different accelerometer-based activity monitors and a pedometer during treadmill walking, 2) to compare the performance of these devices in a free-living environment, and 3) to compare the step counts of three generations of a single device (ActiGraph) against a criterion method. METHODS: Fifty-six individuals wore six activity monitors while performing treadmill walking (40, 54, 67, 80, and 94 m{$\cdot$}min{$^{-1}$}) and during 1 d of free-living activity. The criterion measure of steps during treadmill walking was investigator-determined steps, whereas the criterion measure of steps during the free-living condition was the StepWatch. RESULTS: BMI had no effect on step count accuracy during treadmill walking. The StepWatch, activPAL\texttrademark, and the AG7164 were the most accurate across all speeds, whereas the remaining devices were only accurate at 67 m{$\cdot$}min{$^{-1}$} and faster. In the free-living environment, the AG7164 recorded 99.5\% {$\pm$} 27\% (mean {$\pm$} SD) of StepWatch-determined steps. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that BMI does not affect the step output of commonly used activity monitors during walking. In addition, 67 m{$\cdot$}min{$^{-1}$} seems to be the minimum speed required for accurate step counting, at least for most waist-mounted activity monitors. Finally, the StepWatch, AG7164, and activPAL\texttrademark{} were the most accurate devices on the TM, but only the AG7164 yielded comparable step counts to the StepWatch in the free-living environment.},

Objective: The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the validity and reliability of commercial wearables in measuring step count, heart rate, and energy expenditure. Methods: We identified devices to be included in the review. Database searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, and SPORTDiscus, and only articles published in the English language up to May 2019 were considered. Studies were excluded if they did not identify the device used and if they did not examine the validity or reliability of the device. Studies involving the general population and all special populations were included. We operationalized validity as criterion validity (as compared with other measures) and construct validity (degree to which the device is measuring what it claims). Reliability measures focused on intradevice and interdevice reliability. Results: We included 158 publications examining nine different commercial wearable device brands. Fitbit was by far the most studied brand. In laboratory-based settings, Fitbit, Apple Watch, and Samsung appeared to measure steps accurately. Heart rate measurement was more variable, with Apple Watch and Garmin being the most accurate and Fitbit tending toward underestimation. For energy expenditure, no brand was accurate. We also examined validity between devices within a specific brand. Conclusions: Commercial wearable devices are accurate for measuring steps and heart rate in laboratory-based settings, but this varies by the manufacturer and device type. Devices are constantly being upgraded and redesigned to new models, suggesting the need for more current reviews and research.},

Measurement of gait is a complex process which has been restricted to the laboratory until relatively recently. The application of an inexpensive body worn sensor with appropriate gait algorithms (BWM) is an attractive alternative and offers the potential to assess gait in any setting. In this study we investigated the use of a low-cost BWM, compared to laboratory reference using a robust testing protocol in both younger and older adults. We observed that the BWM is a valid tool for estimating total step count and mean spatio-temporal gait characteristics however agreement for variability and asymmetry results was poor. We conducted a detailed investigation to explain the poor agreement between systems and determined it was due to inherent differences between the systems rather than inability of the sensor to measure the gait characteristics. The results highlight caution in the choice of reference system for validation studies. The BWM used in this study has the potential to gather longitudinal (real-world) spatio-temporal gait data that could be readily used in large lifestyle-based intervention studies, but further refinement of the algorithm(s) is required.},

This study was designed to examine the relationship between the natural variability in epilepsy, and the placebo response seen in trials. We tested the hypothesis that 'reversing' trial direction, with the baseline period as the treatment observation phase, would reveal effects of natural variability. METHOD Clinical trial simulations were run with time running forward and in reverse. Data sources were: SeizureTracker.com (patient reported diaries), a randomized sham-controlled TMS trial, and chronically implanted intracranial EEG electrodes. Outcomes were 50\%-responder rates (RR50) and median percentage change (MPC). RESULTS The RR50 results showed evidence that temporal reversal does not prevent large responder rates across datasets. The MPC results negative in the TMS dataset, and positive in the other two. CONCLUSIONS Typical RR50s of clinical trials can be reproduced using the natural variability of epilepsy as a substrate across multiple datasets. Therefore, the placebo response in epilepsy clinical trials may be attributable almost entirely to this variability, rather than the ``placebo effect''.},

  abstract = {Background: A recent review concludes that the agreement of data across ActiGraph accelerometer models for children and youth still is uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the agreement of three generations of ActiGraph accelerometers in children in a free-living condition. Methods: Sixteen 9-year-olds wore the ActiGraph AM7164, GT1M and GT3X+ simultaneously for three consecutive days. We compared mean counts per minute (mcpm) and time spent at different intensities from the three generations of monitors, and the agreement of outputs were evaluated by intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots. Results: The ICC for mcpm was 0.985 (95\% CI = 0.898, 0.996). We found a relative difference of 11.6\% and 9.8\% between the AM7164 and the GT1M and AM7164 and the GT3X+, respectively. The relative difference between mcpm assessed by the GT1M and GT3X+ was 1.7\%. The inter-generation differences varied in magnitude and direction across intensity levels, with the largest difference found in the highest intensities. Conclusion: We found that the ActiGraph model AM7164 yields higher outputs of mean physical activity intensity (mcpm) than the models GT1M and GT3X+ in children in free-living conditions. The generations GT1M and GT3X+ provided comparable outputs. The differences between the old and the newer monitors were more complex when investigating time spent at different intensities. Comparisons of data assessed by the AM7164 with data assessed by newer generations ActiGraphs should be done with caution.},

  abstract = {Background: The number of days of pedometer or accelerometer data needed to reliably assess physical activity (PA) is important for research that examines the relationship with health. While this important research has been completed in young to middle-aged adults, data is lacking in older adults. Further, data determining the number of days of self-reports PA data is also void. The purpose of this study was to examine the number of days needed to predict habitual PA and sedentary behaviour across pedometer, accelerometer, and physical activity log (PA log) data in older adults.Methods: Participants (52 older men and women; age = 69.3 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 7.4 years, range= 55-86 years) wore a Yamax Digiwalker SW-200 pedometer and an ActiGraph 7164 accelerometer while completing a PA log for 21 consecutive days. Mean differences each instrument and intensity between days of the week were examined using separate repeated measures analysis of variance for with pairwise comparisons. Spearman-Brown Prophecy Formulae based on Intraclass Correlations of .80, .85, .90 and .95 were used to predict the number of days of accelerometer or pedometer wear or PA log daily records needed to represent total PA, light PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA, and sedentary behaviour.Results: Results of this study showed that three days of accelerometer data, four days of pedometer data, or four days of completing PA logs are needed to accurately predict PA levels in older adults. When examining time spent in specific intensities of PA, fewer days of data are needed for accurate prediction of time spent in that activity for ActiGraph but more for the PA log. To accurately predict average daily time spent in sedentary behaviour, five days of ActiGraph data are needed.Conclusions: The number days of objective (pedometer and ActiGraph) and subjective (PA log) data needed to accurately estimate daily PA in older adults was relatively consistent. Despite no statistical differences between days for total PA by the pedometer and ActiGraph, the magnitude of differences between days suggests that day of the week cannot be completely ignored in the design and analysis of PA studies that involve {$<$} 7-day monitoring protocols for these instruments. More days of accelerometer data were needed to determine typical sedentary behaviour than PA level in this population of older adults. \textbackslash copyright 2011 Hart et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract = {Introduction Human body acceleration is often used as an indicator of daily physical activity in epidemiological research. Raw acceleration signals contain three basic components: movement, gravity, and noise. Separation of these becomes increasingly difficult during rotational movements. We aimed to evaluate five different methods (metrics) of processing acceleration signals on their ability to remove the gravitational component of acceleration during standardised mechanical movements and the implications for human daily physical activity assessment. Methods An industrial robot rotated accelerometers in the vertical plane. Radius, frequency, and angular range of motion were systematically varied. Three metrics (Euclidian norm minus one [ENMO], Euclidian norm of the high-pass filtered signals [HFEN], and HFEN plus Euclidean norm of low-pass filtered signals minus 1 g [HFEN+]) were derived for each experimental condition and compared against the reference acceleration (forward kinematics) of the robot arm. We then compared metrics derived from human acceleration signals from the wrist and hip in 97 adults (22\textendash 65 yr), and wrist in 63 women (20\textendash 35 yr) in whom daily activity-related energy expenditure (PAEE) was available. Results In the robot experiment, HFEN+ had lowest error during (vertical plane) rotations at an oscillating frequency higher than the filter cut-off frequency while for lower frequencies ENMO performed better. In the human experiments, metrics HFEN and ENMO on hip were most discrepant (within- and between-individual explained variance of 0.90 and 0.46, respectively). ENMO, HFEN and HFEN+ explained 34\%, 30\% and 36\% of the variance in daily PAEE, respectively, compared to 26\% for a metric which did not attempt to remove the gravitational component (metric EN). Conclusion In conclusion, none of the metrics as evaluated systematically outperformed all other metrics across a wide range of standardised kinematic conditions. However, choice of metric explains different degrees of variance in daily human physical activity.},

Methods~         Thirty children (7\textendash 11 yr) and 30 adults (18\textendash 65 yr) completed eight activities (ranging from lying to running) while wearing one AG and one GA on the hip and the wrist. Oxygen consumption (V\textperiodcentered O2) was measured with indirect calorimetry. Analysis involved the use of ANOVA to examine the effect of activity, brand, and placement on the acceleration values, intraclass correlation coefficient to evaluate the agreement between the two brands and placements, and linear regression to establish intensity thresholds.         Results~         A significant difference in acceleration values between the hip and the wrist placement was found (P {$<$} 0.001). The output from the wrist placement was, in general, higher compared with that from the hip. There was no main effect of monitor brand in adults (P {$<$} 0.12) and children (P {$<$} 0.73), and the intraclass correlation coefficient showed a strong agreement (0.96\textendash 0.99). However, a three-way interaction and systematic error between the brands was found in children. Acceleration from both brands and placements showed a strong correlation with V\textperiodcentered O2. The intensity classification accuracy of the developed thresholds for both brands and placements was, in general, higher for adults compared with that for children and was greater for sedentary/light (93\%\textendash 97\%), and vigorous activities (68\%\textendash 92\%) than that for moderate activities (33\%\textendash 59\%).         Conclusions~         Accelerometer outputs from AG and GA seem comparable when attached to the same body location in adults, whereas inconsistent differences are apparent between the two brands and placements in children, hence limiting the comparability between brands in this age group.},

  abstract = {Importance: Affordable, quantitative methods to screen children for developmental delays are needed. Motor milestones can be an indicator of developmental delay and may be used to track developmental progress. Accelerometry offers a way to gather real-world information about pediatric motor behavior. Objective: To develop a referent cohort of pediatric accelerometry from bilateral upper extremities (UEs) and determine whether movement can accurately distinguish those with and without motor deficits. Design, Setting, and Participants: Children aged 0 to 17 years participated in a prospective cohort from December 8, 2014, to December 29, 2017. Children were recruited from Ranken Jordan Pediatric Bridge Hospital, Maryland Heights, Missouri, and Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri. Typically developing children were included as a referent cohort if they had no history of motor or neurological deficit; consecutive sampling and matching ensured equal representation of sex and age. Children with diagnosed asymmetric motor deficits were included in the motor impaired cohort. Exposures: Bilateral UE motor activity was measured using wrist-worn accelerometers for a total of 100 hours in 25-hour increments. Main Outcomes and Measures: To characterize bilateral UE motor activity in a referent cohort for the purpose of detecting irregularities in the future, total activity and the use ratio between UEs were used to describe typically developing children. Asymmetric impairment was classified using the mono-arm use index (MAUI) and bilateral-arm use index (BAUI) to quantify the acceleration of unilateral movements. Results: A total of 216 children enrolled, and 185 children were included in analysis. Of these, 156 were typically developing, with mean (SD) age 9.1 (5.1) years and 81 boys (52.0\%). There were 29 children in the motor impaired cohort, with mean (SD) age 7.4 (4.4) years and 16 boys (55.2\%). The combined MAUI and BAUI (mean [SD], 0.86 [0.005] and use ratio (mean [SD], 0.90 [0.008]) had similar F1 values. The area under the curve was also similar between the combined MAUI and BAUI (mean [SD], 0.98 [0.004]) and the use ratio (mean [SD], 0.98 [0.004]). Conclusions and Relevance: Bilateral UE movement as measured with accelerometry may provide a meaningful metric of real-world motor behavior across childhood. Screening in early childhood remains a challenge; MAUI may provide an effective method for clinicians to measure and visualize real-world motor behavior in children at risk for asymmetrical deficits.},

When these sensors are attached to the subject's body, they permit continuous monitoring of numerous physiological signals. This has appealing use in healthcare applications, e.g. the exploitation of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) in daily activity monitoring for elderly people. In this paper, we present a system for human physical Activity Recognition (AR) using smartphone inertial sensors. As these mobile phones are limited in terms of energy and computing power, we propose a novel hardware-friendly approach for multiclass classification. This method adapts the standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) and exploits fixed-point arithmetic for computational cost reduction. A comparison with the traditional SVM shows a significant improvement in terms of computational costs while maintaining similar accuracy, which can contribute to develop more sustainable systems for AmI.},

Methods: Seventy-five epilepsy surgery candidates undergoing video-EEG monitoring were included. The patients wore one three-axis accelerometer on each wrist during video-EEG. The accelerometer data was band-pass filtered and reduced using a movement threshold and mapped to a time-frequency feature space representation. Algorithms based on standard binary classifiers combined with a TCS specific event detection layer were developed and trained using the training set. Their performance was evaluated in terms of sensitivity and false positive (FP) rate using the test set. Results: Thirty-seven available TCSs in 11 patients were recorded and the data was divided into disjoint training (27 TCSs, three patients) and test (10 TCSs, eight patients) data sets. The classification algorithms evaluated were K-nearest-neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF) and a linear kernel support vector machine (SVM). For the TCSs detection performance of the three algorithms in the test set, the highest sensitivity was obtained for KNN (100\% sensitivity, 0.05 FP/h) and the lowest FP rate was obtained for RF (90\% sensitivity, 0.01 FP/h). Conclusions: The low FP rate enhances the clinical utility of the detection system for long-term reliable seizure monitoring. It also allows a possible implementation of an automated TCS detection in free-living environment, which could contribute to ascertain seizure frequency and thereby better seizure management.},

  abstract = {Recently, with the development of artificial intelligence technologies and the popularity of mobile devices, walking detection and step counting have gained much attention since they play an important role in the fields of equipment positioning, saving energy, behavior recognition, etc. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed to simultaneously detect walking motion and count steps through unconstrained smartphones in the sense that the smartphone placement is not only arbitrary but also alterable. On account of the periodicity of the walking motion and sensitivity of gyroscopes, the proposed algorithm extracts the frequency domain features from three-dimensional (3D) angular velocities of a smartphone through FFT (fast Fourier transform) and identifies whether its holder is walking or not irrespective of its placement. Furthermore, the corresponding step frequency is recursively updated to evaluate the step count in real time. Extensive experiments are conducted by involving eight subjects and different walking scenarios in a realistic environment. It is shown that the proposed method achieves the precision of 93.76\% and recall of 93.65\% for walking detection, and its overall performance is significantly better than other well-known methods. Moreover, the accuracy of step counting by the proposed method is 95.74\%, and is better than both of the several well-known counterparts and commercial products.},

  abstract = {Quantifying gait parameters and ambulatory monitoring of changes in these parameters have become increasingly important in epidemiological and clinical studies. Using high-density accelerometry measurements, we propose adaptive empirical pattern transformation (ADEPT), a fast, scalable, and accurate method for segmentation of individual walking strides. ADEPT computes the covariance between a scaled and translated pattern function and the data, an idea similar to the continuous wavelet transform. The difference is that ADEPT uses a data-based pattern function, allows multiple pattern functions, can use other distances instead of the covariance, and the pattern function is not required to satisfy the wavelet admissibility condition. Compared to many existing approaches, ADEPT is designed to work with data collected at various body locations and is invariant to the direction of accelerometer axes relative to body orientation. The method is applied to and validated on accelerometry data collected during a 450-m outdoor walk of 32 study participants wearing accelerometers on the wrist, hip, and both ankles. Additionally, all scripts and data needed to reproduce presented results are included in supplementary material available at Biostatistics online.},

High-definition video and mobile reference speed capture served to validate different algorithms. Results Particularly at slow gait speeds, relevant improvements in accuracy have been achieved. Compared to the reference the deviation was less than 1\% in step detection and less than 0.05 m/s in gait speed measurements, even for slow walking subjects ({$<$} 0.8 m/s). Conclusion With the described setup, algorithms for step and gait speed detection have successfully been validated in an elderly population and demonstrated to have improved performance versus previously published algorithms. These results are promising that long-term and/or real-world measurements are possible with an acceptable accuracy even in elderly frail patients with slow gait speeds.},

  abstract = {Background: Huntington's disease (HD) leads to altered gait patterns and reduced daily-living physical activity. Accurate measurement of daily-living walking that takes into account involuntary movements (e.g. chorea) is needed. Objective: To evaluate daily-living gait quantity and quality in HD, taking into account irregular movements. Methods: Forty-two individuals with HD and fourteen age-matched non-HD peers completed clinic-based assessments and a standardized laboratory-based circuit of functional activities, wearing inertial measurement units on the wrists, legs, and trunk. These activities were used to train and test an algorithm for the automated detection of walking. Subsequently, 29 HD participants and 22 age-matched non-HD peers wore a tri-axial accelerometer on their non-dominant wrist for 7 days. Measures included gait quantity (e.g., steps per day), gait quality (e.g., regularity) metrics, and percentage of walking bouts with irregular movements. Results: Measures of daily-living gait quantity including step counts, walking time and bouts per day were similar in HD participants and non-HD peers (p {$>$} 0.05). HD participants with higher clinician-rated upper body chorea had a greater percentage of walking bouts with irregular movements compared to those with lower chorea (p = 0.060) and non-HD peers (p {$<$} 0.001). Even after accounting for irregular movements, within-bout walking consistency was lower in HD participants compared to non-HD peers (p {$<$} 0.001), while across-bout variability of these measures was higher (p {$<$} 0.001). Many of the daily-living measures were associated with disease-specific measures of motor function. Conclusions: Results suggest that a wrist-worn accelerometer can be used to evaluate the quantity and quality of daily-living gait in people with HD, while accounting for the influence of irregular (choreic-like) movements, and that gait features related to within- and across-bout consistency markedly differ in individuals with HD and non-HD peers.},

  abstract = {Numerous gait event detection (GED) algorithms have been developed using accelerometers as they allow the possibility of long-term gait analysis in everyday life. However, almost all such existing algorithms have been developed and assessed using data collected in controlled indoor experiments with pre-defined paths and walking speeds. On the contrary, human gait is quite dynamic in the real-world, often involving varying gait speeds, changing surfaces and varying surface inclinations. Though portable wearable systems can be used to conduct experiments directly in the real-world, there is a lack of publicly available gait datasets or studies evaluating the performance of existing GED algorithms in various real-world settings. This paper presents a new gait database called MAREA (n = 20 healthy subjects) that consists of walking and running in indoor and outdoor environments with accelerometers positioned on waist, wrist and both ankles. The study also evaluates the performance of six state-of-the-art accelerometer-based GED algorithms in different real-world scenarios, using the MAREA gait database. The results reveal that the performance of these algorithms is inconsistent and varies with changing environments and gait speeds. All algorithms demonstrated good performance for the scenario of steady walking in a controlled indoor environment with a combined median F1score of 0.98 for Heel-Strikes and 0.94 for Toe-Offs. However, they exhibited significantly decreased performance when evaluated in other lesser controlled scenarios such as walking and running in an outdoor street, with a combined median F1score of 0.82 for Heel-Strikes and 0.53 for Toe-Offs. Moreover, all GED algorithms displayed better performance for detecting Heel-Strikes as compared to Toe-Offs, when evaluated in different scenarios.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Recently, several simple and cost-effective pedestrian navigation systems (PNS) have been introduced. These systems utilized accelerometers and gyros in order to determine step, stride and heading. The performance of the PNS depends on not only the accuracy of the sensors but also the measurement processing methods. In most PNS, a vertical impact is measured to detect a step. A step is counted when the measured vertical impact is larger than the given threshold. The numbers of steps are miscounted sometimes since the vertical impacts are not correctly measured due to inclination of the foot. Because the stride is not constant and changes with speed, the step length parameter must be determined continuously during the walk in order to get the accurate travelled distance. Also, to get the accurate heading, it is required to overcome drawbacks of low grade gyro and magnetic compass. This paper proposes new step, stride and heading determination methods for the pedestrian navigation system: A new reliable step determination method based on pattern recognition is proposed from the analysis of the vertical and horizontal acceleration of the foot during one step of the walking. A simple and robust stride determination method is also obtained by analysing the relationship between stride, step period and acceleration. Furthermore, a new integration method of gyroscope and magnetic compass gives a reliable heading. The walking test is preformed using the implemented system consists of a 1-axis accelerometer, a 1-axis gyroscope, a magnetic compass and 16-bit microprocessor. The results of walking test confirmed the proposed method.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The expanding armamentarium of wearable activity monitors (WAMs) offers new opportunities to supplement physician-assessed performance status (PS) with real-life patient activity data. These data could guide clinical decision making or serve as a measure of treatment outcome. However, information on the association between physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) monitored with wearables (i.e., WAM metrics) and PS in patients with cancer is needed. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to examine the association between WAM metrics and PS in patients with cancer. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and Embase for studies that assessed the association between WAM metrics and performance status among adults with cancer. We extracted information on study design and population, WAM type and different activity metrics, outcome definitions, and results. Included studies were subjected to risk of bias assessment and subsequent best evidence synthesis. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in this review. All studies reported on different combinations of WAM metrics including: daily steps (n = 8), SB (n = 5), mean activity counts (n = 4), dichotomous circadian rest-activity index (n = 3), and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) (n = 3). Much heterogeneity was observed regarding study population, WAM used, and reporting of results. We found moderate evidence for a positive weak-to-moderate association between WAM-assessed PA and PS and a weak-to-moderate negative association between WAM-assessed SB metrics and PS. CONCLUSION: Weak-to-moderate associations between WAM metrics and PS suggest that WAM data and physician-assessed PS cannot be used interchangeably. Instead, WAM data could serve as a dynamic and objective supplement measurement of patients' physical performance.},

Existing tests designed to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases, while well-validated, are often less effective in detecting deviations from normal cognitive decline trajectory in the earliest stages of the disease. In the quest for gold standards for AD assessment, there is a growing interest in the identification of readily accessible digital biomarkers, which harness advances in consumer grade mobile and wearable technologies. Topics examined include a review of existing early clinical manifestations of AD and a path to the respective sensor and mobile/wearable device usage to acquire domain-centric data towards objective, high frequency and passive digital phenotyping.}

Unattended seizures can have serious consequences including injury or death. The objective of this study is to develop a small, portable, wearable device capable of detecting seizures and alerting patients and families on recognition of specific seizures' motor activity. Ictal data were prospectively obtained in consecutive patients admitted to two video-EEG units. This study included patients with a history of motor seizures, clonic or tonic, or tonic-clonic seizures or patients with complex partial seizures with frequent secondary generalization. A ``Motion Sensor'' unit mounted on a bracelet was attached to one wrist. The ``Sensor'' contains a three-axis accelerometer and a transmitter. The three-axis movements' data were transmitted to a portable computer. Algorithm specially developed for this purpose analyzed the recorded data. Seizures' alerts were compared with the video-EEG data. Ictal data were acquired in 15 of the 31 recruited patients. The algorithm correctly identified 20 of 22 (91\%) captured seizures and generated an alarm within a median period of 17 seconds. All events lasting Ͼ30 seconds (i.e., 19 events) were identified. The system failed to identify 2 of 22 seizures (9\%). There were eight false alarms during 1,692 hours of monitoring. Preliminary data suggest that this motion detection device/alarm system can identify most motor seizures with high sensitivity and with a low false alarm rate.},

Several studies validating the IPAQ-SF have been conducted with differing results, but no systematic review of these studies has been reported. Methods The keywords "IPAQ", "validation", and "validity" were searched in PubMed and Scopus. Studies published in English that validated the IPAQ-SF against an objective physical activity measuring device, doubly labeled water, or an objective fitness measure were included. Results Twenty-three validation studies were included in this review. There was a great deal of variability in the methods used across studies, but the results were largely similar. Correlations between the total physical activity level measured by the IPAQ-SF and objective standards ranged from 0.09 to 0.39; none reached the minimal acceptable standard in the literature (0.50 for objective activity measuring devices, 0.40 for fitness measures). Correlations between sections of the IPAQ-SF for vigorous activity or moderate activity level/walking and an objective standard showed even greater variability (-0.18 to 0.76), yet several reached the minimal acceptable standard. Only six studies provided comparisons between physical activity levels derived from the IPAQ-SF and those obtained from objective criterion. In most studies the IPAQ-SF overestimated physical activity level by 36 to 173 percent; one study underestimated by 28 percent. Conclusions The correlation between the IPAQ-SF and objective measures of activity or fitness in the large majority of studies was lower than the acceptable standard. Furthermore, the IPAQ-SF typically overestimated physical activity as measured by objective criterion by an average of 84 percent. Hence, the evidence to support the use of the IPAQ-SF as an indicator of relative or absolute physical activity is weak.},

A literature search of papers was done on multimodal seizure detection with extraction of data on type of modalities, study design and algorithm, sensitivity, false detection rate, and seizure types. Evidence of superiority was sought for using multiple instead of single modalities. Seven papers were found from 2010 to 2017, mostly using contact sensors such as accelerometers (n = 5), electromyography (n = 2), heart rate (n = 2), electrodermal activity (n = 1), and oximetry (n = 1). Remote sensors included video, radar, movement, and sound. All studies but one were in-hospital, with video-EEG as a gold standard. Algorithms were based on physiology and supervised machine learning, but did not always include a separate test dataset. Sensitivity ranged from 4\% to 100\% and false detection rate from 0.25 to 20 per 8 hours. Tonic\textendash clonic seizure detection performed best. False detections tended to be restricted to a minority (16\%-30\%) of patients. Use of multiple sensors increased sensitivity; false detections decreased in one study, but increased in another.},

  abstract = {Driver drowsiness is a significant contributing factor to road accidents and can lead to severe physical injuries, deaths, and significant economic losses. Earlier research primarily concentrated on estimating the level of drowsiness using a single measure such as lane or steering monitoring, behavioral measures or physiological ones. Hybrid systems employing multiple measures provide more reliable solutions because they minimize the number of false alarms and maintain a high recognition rate, which promote their acceptance. In this paper, we present an unobtrusive system that combines a dashboard-mount camera alongside with a watch-like wearable system recording optical (PPG) signals. Statistical analysis performed on 17 subjects demonstrates that our hybrid drowsiness detection system, which leverages both physiological and behavioral measures can reliably determine the drowsiness level with an accuracy ranging from 86\% to 96\% depending on the number of levels and the classification method used.},

  abstract = {Background: It has become possible for the new generation of consumer wristbands to classify sleep stages based on multisensory data. Several studies have validated the accuracy of one of the latest models, that is, Fitbit Charge 2, in measuring polysomnographic parameters, including total sleep time, wake time, sleep efficiency (SE), and the ratio of each sleep stage. Nevertheless, its accuracy in measuring sleep stage transitions remains unknown. Objective: This study aimed to examine the accuracy of Fitbit Charge 2 in measuring transition probabilities among wake, light sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep under free-living conditions. The secondary goal was to investigate the effect of user-specific factors, including demographic information and sleep pattern on measurement accuracy. Methods: A Fitbit Charge 2 and a medical device were used concurrently to measure a whole night's sleep in participants' homes. Sleep stage transition probabilities were derived from sleep hypnograms. Measurement errors were obtained by comparing the data obtained by Fitbit with those obtained by the medical device. Paired 2-tailed t test and Bland-Altman plots were used to examine the agreement of Fitbit to the medical device. Wilcoxon signed\textendash rank test was performed to investigate the effect of user-specific factors. Results: Sleep data were collected from 23 participants. Sleep stage transition probabilities measured by Fitbit Charge 2 significantly deviated from those measured by the medical device, except for the transition probability from deep sleep to wake, from light sleep to REM sleep, and the probability of staying in REM sleep. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated that systematic bias ranged from 0\% to 60\%. Fitbit had the tendency of overestimating the probability of staying in a sleep stage while underestimating the probability of transiting to another stage. SE{$>$}90\% (P=.047) was associated with significant increase in measurement error. Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI){$<$}5 and wake after sleep onset (WASO){$<$}30 min could be associated to significantly decreased or increased errors, depending on the outcome sleep metrics. Conclusions: Our analysis shows that Fitbit Charge 2 underestimated sleep stage transition dynamics compared with the medical device. Device accuracy may be significantly affected by perceived sleep quality (PSQI), WASO, and SE.},

Individuals admitted for continuous video/EEG monitoring wore a wristwatch-size device that was programmed to detect rhythmic movements such as those that occur during tonic\textendash clonic seizures. When such movement was detected, the device sent a Bluetooth signal to a computer that registered the time and duration of the movements. Recorded detections were compared with the routinely recorded video/EEG data. Six of 40 patients had a total of eight tonic\textendash clonic seizures. Seven of the eight seizures were detected. Nonseizure movements were detected 204 times, with opportunity for canceling transmission by the patient. Only one false detection occurred during sleep. In principle, this device should allow caregivers of people with tonic\textendash clonic seizures to be alerted when a seizure occurs.},

Step detection and step length estimation (SLE) are two essential components for the pedestrian navigation based on PDR. To solve the overcounting problem, this study proposes a peak-valley detection method, which can remove the abnormal values effectively. The current step length models mostly depend on individual parameters that need to be predetermined for different users. Based on fuzzy logic (FL), we establish a rule base that can adjust the coefficient in the Weinberg model adaptively for every detected step of various human shapes walking. Specifically, to determine the FL rule base, we collect user acceleration data from 10 volunteers walking under the combination of diverse step length and stride frequency, and each one walks 49 times at all. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method adapts to different kinds of persons walking at various step velocities. Peak-valley detection can achieve an average accuracy of 99.77\% during 500 steps of free walking. Besides, the average errors of 5 testers are all less than 4\,m per 100\,m and the smallest one is 1.74\,m per 100\,m using our coefficient self-determined step length estimation model.},

  abstract = {Movement-based sleep-wake detection devices (i.e., actigraphy devices) were first developed in the early 1970s and have repeatedly been validated against polysomnography, which is considered the ``gold-standard'' of sleep measurement. Indeed, they have become important tools for objectively inferring sleep in free-living conditions. Standard actigraphy devices are rooted in accelerometry to measure movement and make predictions, via scoring algorithms, as to whether the wearer is in a state of wakefulness or sleep. Two important developments have become incorporated in newer devices. First, additional sensors, including measures of heart rate and heart rate variability and higher resolution movement sensing through triaxial accelerometers, have been introduced to improve upon traditional, movement-based scoring algorithms. Second, these devices have transcended scientific utility and are now being manufactured and distributed to the general public. This review will provide an overview of: (1) the history of actigraphic sleep measurement, (2) the physiological underpinnings of heart rate and heart rate variability measurement in wearables, (3) the refinement and validation of both standard actigraphy and newer, multisensory devices for real-world sleep-wake detection, (4) the practical applications of actigraphy, (5) important limitations of actigraphic measurement, and lastly (6) future directions within the field.}

This is the first publicly available database focused on capturing gait patterns of typical real-world environments, such as grade (up-, down-, and cross-slopes), regularity (paved, uneven stone, grass), and stair negotiation (up and down). As such, the database contains data with only subtle differences between conditions, allowing for the development of robust analysis techniques capable of detecting small, but significant changes in gait mechanics. With analysis code provided, we anticipate that this database will provide a foundation for research that explores machine learning applications for mobile sensing and real-time recognition of subtle gait adaptations.},

First it is shown that during tonic seizures the typical ACMpattern is mainly caused by change of position towards the field of gravity and that the acceleration caused by movement is negligible. To this end a mechanical model of the arm and physiological information about muscle contraction during tonic seizures are used. Then six features are computed that represent the main characteristics of ACM-patterns associated with tonic seizures. Linear discriminant analysis is used for classification. For training and evaluation ACM-data are used from mentally retarded patients with severe epilepsy. It was possible to detect tonic seizures with a success rate around 0.80 and with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.35. For off-line analysis this is acceptable, especially when 42 \% of the false alarms are actually motor seizures of another type. The missed seizures, were not clearly visible in the ACM-signal. For these seizures additional ACM-sensors or a combination with other sensor types might be necessary. The results show that our approach is useful for the automated detection of tonic seizures and that it is a promising contribution in a complete multi-sensor seizure detection setup.},

Design: Participants underwent overnight sleep assessment simultaneously by polysomnography (PSG) and actigraphy. Setting: Overnight sleep study in academic sleep research laboratory. Participants: Sixty-one patients (mean age 67.74 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 8.88 y) with mild to moderate PD. Measurements: Sleep measures including total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep onset latency (SOL) were calculated independently from data derived from PSG and from actigraphy. Different actigraphy scoring settings were compared. Results: No single tested actigraphy scoring setting was optimal for all sleep measures. A customized setting of an activity threshold of 10, with five consecutive immobile minutes for sleep onset, yielded the combination of mean TST, SE, and WASO values that best approximated mean values determined by PSG with differences of 6.05 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 85.67 min for TST, 1.1 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.641\% for SE, and 4.35 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 59.56 min for WASO. There were significant but moderate correlations between actigraphy and PSG measurements (rs = 0.496, P {$<$} 0.001 for TST, rs = 0.384, P = 0.002 for SE, and rs = 0.400, P = 0.001 for WASO) using these settings. Greater disease stage was associated with greater differences between TST (R2 = 0.099, beta = 0.315, P = 0.018), SE (R2 = 0.107, beta = 0.327, P = 0.014), and WASO (R 2 = 0.094, beta = 0.307, P = 0.021) values derived by actigraphy and PSG explaining some of the variability. Using a setting of 10 immobile min for sleep onset yielded a mean SOL that was within 1 min of that estimated by PSG. However SOL values determined by actigraphy and PSG were not significantly correlated at any tested setting. Conclusions: Our results suggest that actigraphy may be useful for measurement of mean TST, SE, and WASO values in groups of patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease. However, there is a significant degree of variability in accuracy among individual patients. The importance of determining optimal scoring parameters for each population studied is underscored.},

  abstract = {Patients with atopic dermatitis experience increased nocturnal pruritus which leads to scratching and sleep disturbances that significantly contribute to poor quality of life. Objective measurements of nighttime scratching and sleep quantity can help assess the efficacy of an intervention. Wearable sensors can provide novel, objective measures of nighttime scratching and sleep; however, many current approaches were not designed for passive, unsupervised monitoring during daily life. In this work, we present the development and analytical validation of a method that sequentially processes epochs of sample-level accelerometer data from a wrist-worn device to provide continuous digital measures of nighttime scratching and sleep quantity. This approach uses heuristic and machine learning algorithms in a hierarchical paradigm by first determining when the patient intends to sleep, then detecting sleep\textendash wake states along with scratching episodes, and lastly deriving objective measures of both sleep and scratch. Leveraging reference data collected in a sleep laboratory (NCT ID: NCT03490877), results show that sensor-derived measures of total sleep opportunity (TSO; time when patient intends to sleep) and total sleep time (TST) correlate well with reference polysomnography data (TSO: r\,=\,0.72, p\,{$<$}\,0.001; TST: r\,=\,0.76, p\,{$<$}\,0.001; N\,=\,32). Log transformed sensor derived measures of total scratching duration achieve strong agreement with reference annotated video recordings (r\,=\,0.82, p\,{$<$}\,0.001; N\,=\,25). These results support the use of wearable sensors for objective, continuous measurement of nighttime scratching and sleep during daily life.},

Here, we presented a novel algorithm to detect FoG in a group of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) in the laboratory (Study I) and extended the algorithm in a second cohort of people with PD at home during daily life (Study II). In Study I, we described of our novel FoG detection algorithm based on five inertial sensors attached to the feet, shins and lumbar region while walking in 40 participants with PD. We compared the performance of the algorithm with two expert clinical raters who scored the number of FoG episodes from video recordings of walking and turning based on duration of the episodes: very short ( 5 s). In Study II, a different cohort of 48 people with PD (with and without FoG) wore 3 wearable sensors on their feet and lumbar region for 7 days. Our primary outcome measures for freezing were the \% time spent freezing and its variability. We showed moderate to good agreement in the number of FoG episodes detected in the laboratory (Study I) between clinical raters and the algorithm (if wearable sensors were placed on the feet) for short and long FoG episodes, but not for very short FoG episodes. When extending this methodology to unsupervised home monitoring (Study II), we found that percent time spent freezing and the variability of time spent freezing differentiated between people with and without FoG (p {$<$} 0.05), and that short FoG episodes account for 69\% of the total FoG episodes. Our findings showed that objective measures of freezing in PD using inertial sensors on the feet in the laboratory are matching well with clinical scores. Although results found during daily life are promising, they need to be validated. Objective measures of FoG with wearable technology during community-living would be useful for managing this distressing feature of mobility disability in PD.},

  abstract = {Background: Walking represents a major component of physical activity (PA), and its restriction could degrade autonomy and quality of life. An important objective for preventive and/or rehabilitative strategies to improve balance and gait in normal and pathological aging conditions is to focus on physical activity. Activity monitors have recently been getting increasingly popular and represent a modern solution to measure\textemdash and communicate\textemdash PA notably in terms of steps/day. These activity monitors are well-suited for various populations as they can be worn on a variety of locations on the body, including the wrist and the hip (i.e., the two most common locations), in an undifferentiated way according to the manufacturer's instruction. The aim of this study was hence to verify potential differences in step count (SC) by comparing this parameter assessed using wrist- and hip-worn activity trackers over a 24-h period in free-living conditions in young and older adults. Methods: Young adults (n = 22) and older adults (n = 22) voluntarily participated in this study. They were required to wear two commercially-available Actigraph GT3X+ activity monitors simultaneously at two locations recommended by the manufacturer, i.e., one positioned around the wrist and one above the hip, over a 24-h period in free-living conditions. The manufacturer's software was used to obtain estimates of the SC. Results: For both groups, the wrist-worn activity tracker provided significantly higher SC than the hip-worn activity tracker did. For both placements on the body, older adults exhibited significantly lower SC than young adults. Interestingly, for both young and older participants, the difference between both measurements tended to decrease for longer distances. Conclusion: The different estimations of the step count provided by the comparison between two identical Actigraph GT3x on the wrist or the hip during the 24-h observation period in free-living conditions in young and older adults strongly suggests that caution is needed when using total step per day values as an outcome to quantify walking behavior. Probably we can suggest the same caution across implementation of different activity Tracker.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We validated actigraphy for detecting sleep and wakefulness versus polysomnography (PSG). DESIGN: Actigraphy and polysomnography were simultaneously collected during sleep laboratory admissions. All studies involved 8.5 h time in bed, except for sleep restriction studies. Epochs (30-sec; n = 232,849) were characterized for sensitivity (actigraphy = sleep when PSG = sleep), specificity (actigraphy = wake when PSG = wake), and accuracy (total proportion correct); the amount of wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO) was also assessed. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model included age, gender, insomnia diagnosis, and daytime/nighttime sleep timing factors. SETTING: Controlled sleep laboratory conditions. PARTICIPANTS: Young and older adults, healthy or chronic primary insomniac (PI) patients, and daytime sleep of 23 night-workers (n = 77, age 35.0 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 12.5, 30F, mean nights = 3.2). INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Overall, sensitivity (0.965) and accuracy (0.863) were high, whereas specificity (0.329) was low; each was only slightly modified by gender, insomnia, day/night sleep timing (magnitude of change 30 min/night. CONCLUSIONS: This validation quantifies strengths and weaknesses of actigraphy as a tool measuring sleep in clinical and population studies. Overall, the participant-specific accuracy is relatively high, and for most participants, above 80\%. We validate this finding across multiple nights and a variety of adults across much of the young to midlife years, in both men and women, in those with and without insomnia, and in 77 participants. We conclude that actigraphy is overall a useful and valid means for estimating total sleep time and wakefulness after sleep onset in field and workplace studies, with some limitations in specificity.},

  abstract = {Cancer-related fatigue can continue long after curative cancer treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate sleep and rest\textendash activity cycles in fatigued and non-fatigued cancer survivors. We hypothesized that sleep and rest\textendash activity cycles would be more disturbed in people experiencing clinically-relevant fatigue, and that objective measures of sleep would be associated with the severity of fatigue in cancer survivors. Cancer survivors (n = 87) completed a 14-day wrist actigraphy measurement to estimate their sleep and rest\textendash activity cycles. Fatigue was measured using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F). Participants were dichotomised into two groups using a previously validated score (fatigued n = 51 and non-fatigued n = 36). The participant's perception of sleep was measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). FACIT-F score was correlated with wake after sleep onset (r = -0.28; p = 0.010), sleep efficiency (r = 0.26; p = 0.016), sleep onset latency (r = -0.31; p = 0.044) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score (r = -0.56; p {$<$} 0.001). The relative amplitude of the rest\textendash activity cycles was lower in the fatigued vs. the non-fatigued group (p = 0.017; d = 0.58). After treatment for cancer, the severity of cancer-related fatigue is correlated with specific objective measures of sleep, and there is evidence of rest\textendash activity cycle disruption in people experiencing clinically-relevant fatigue.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a weighted context-based step length estimation algorithm for pedestrian dead reckoning. Six pedestrian contexts are considered: stationary, walking, walking sideways, climbing and descending stairs, and running. Instead of computing the step length based on a single context, the step lengths computed for different contexts are weighted by the context probabilities. This provides more robust performance when the context is uncertain. The proposed step length estimation algorithm is part of a pedestrian dead reckoning system which includes the procedures of step detection and context classification. The step detection algorithm detects the step time boundaries using continuous wavelet transform analysis, while the context classification algorithm determines the pedestrian context probabilities using a relevance vector machine. In order to assess the performance of the pedestrian dead reckoning system, a dataset of pedestrian activities and actions has been collected. Fifteen subjects have been equipped with a waist-belt smartphone and traveled along a predefined path. Acceleration, angular rate and magnetic field data were recorded. The results show that the traveled distance is more accurate using step lengths weighted by the context probabilities compared to using step lengths based on the highest probability context.},

  abstract = {Freezing of gait (FoG) is a motor impairment among patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, associated with falls and negative impact on patient's quality of life. Detecting such freezes allows real-time gait monitoring to reduce the risk of falls. We investigate the correlation between wrist movements and the freezing of the gait in Parkinsons disease, targeting FoG-detection from wrist-worn sensing data. While most of research focuses on placing inertial sensors on lower limb, i.e., foot, ankle, thigh, we focus on the wrist as an alternative placement. Commonly worn accessories at the wrist such as watches or wristbands are more likely to be accepted and easier to be worn by elderly users, especially subjects with motor problems. Experiments on data from 11 subjects with Parkinson's disease and FoG show there are specific features from wrist movements which are related to gait freeze, such the power on different frequency ranges and statistical information from acceleration and rotation data. Moreover, FoG can be detected by using wrist motion and machine learning models with a FoG hit rate of 0.9, and a specificity between 0.66-0.8. Compared with the state-of-the-art lower limb information used to detect FoG, the wrist increases the number of false detected events, while preserving the FoG hit-rate and detection latency. This suggests that wrist sensors can be a feasible alternative to the cumbersome placement on the legs.},

  abstract = {Objective Seizure forecasting may provide patients with timely warnings to adapt their daily activities and help clinicians deliver more objective, personalized treatments. Although recent work has convincingly demonstrated that seizure risk assessment is in principle possible, these early approaches relied largely on complex, often invasive setups including intracranial electrocorticography, implanted devices, and multichannel electroencephalography, and required patient-specific adaptation or learning to perform optimally, all of which limit translation to broad clinical application. To facilitate broader adaptation of seizure forecasting in clinical practice, noninvasive, easily applicable techniques that reliably assess seizure risk without much prior tuning are crucial. Wristbands that continuously record physiological parameters, including electrodermal activity, body temperature, blood volume pulse, and actigraphy, may afford monitoring of autonomous nervous system function and movement relevant for such a task, hence minimizing potential complications associated with invasive monitoring and avoiding stigma associated with bulky external monitoring devices on the head. Methods Here, we applied deep learning on multimodal wristband sensor data from 69 patients with epilepsy (total duration {$>$} 2311 hours, 452 seizures) to assess its capability to forecast seizures in a statistically significant way. Results Using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation approach, we identified better-than-chance predictability in 43\% of the patients. Time-matched seizure surrogate data analyses indicated forecasting not to be driven simply by time of day or vigilance state. Prediction performance peaked when all sensor modalities were used, and did not differ between generalized and focal seizure types, but generally increased with the size of the training dataset, indicating potential further improvement with larger datasets in the future. Significance Collectively, these results show that statistically significant seizure risk assessments are feasible from easy-to-use, noninvasive wearable devices without the need of patient-specific training or parameter optimization.},

Previous contributions have adopted various pre-processing approaches for gait accelerometry signals, but none have thoroughly investigated the effects of such pre-processing operations on the obtained results. Therefore, this paper investigated the influence of pre-processing operations on signal features extracted from gait accelerometry signals. These signals were collected from 35 participants aged over 65 years-old: 14 of them were healthy controls (HC), 10 had Parkinson's disease (PD) and 11 had peripheral neuropathy (PN). The participants walked on a treadmill at preferred speed. Signal features in time, frequency and time-frequency domains were computed for both raw and preprocessed signals. The pre-processing stage consisted of applying tilt correction and de-noising operations to acquired signals. We first examined the effects of these operations separately, followed by the investigation of their joint effects. Several important observations were made based on the obtained results. First, the denoising operation alone had almost no effects in comparison to the trends observed in the raw data. Second, the tilt correction affected the reported results to a certain degree, which could lead to a better discrimination between groups. Third, the combination of the two pre-processing operations yielded similar trends as the tilt correction alone. These results indicated that while gait accelerometry is a valuable approach for the gait assessment, one has to carefully adopt any pre-processing steps as they alter the observed findings.},

  abstract = {Parameters of the human gait cycle are commonly used for the evaluation and diagnosis of motor and neurological disorders. Traditionally, biomechanical analysis is performed in specialized laboratories, but in these locations, the subject does not perform a natural gait and tends to hide or exaggerate their alterations. Therefore, in this paper, we characterized eighteen signals per experiment: six from gyroscopes and six from accelerometers of a smartwatch (Apple Watch Series 3) worn on each wrist, and three from gyroscopes of an inertial sensors placed on the ankles. Signals were collected from twenty young and healthy subjects without pathological history. Subjects walked naturally in a straight-line for 25 meters. Each subject performed the walking cycle several times for 6 minutes, 3600 signals were thus analyzed. Each signal was characterized using time domain, frequency domain and nonlinear measurements. Results show that angular velocity in the Z-axis contains relevant information to characterize human gait in both ankles and the wrist. Also, typical gait parameters were obtained from the smartwatch signals. The sample entropy showed that signals that have greater self-similarity are those that contain more information, such as angular velocity signals on the Z-axis in each ankle and wrist. This characterization could be useful for the automatic identification of the human gait cycle, the detection of pathologies and the recognition of people from human gait patterns using only the information extracted from sensors embedded in smartphones and smartwatches.},

In this study an ambulatory FOG monitor was validated in 11 PD patients. The vertical linear acceleration of the left shank was acquired using an ankle-mounted sensor array that transmitted data wirelessly to a pocket PC at a rate of 100 Hz. Power analysis showed high-frequency components of leg movement during FOG in the 3\textendash 8 Hz band that were not apparent during volitional standing, and power in this `freeze' band was higher (p = 0.00003) during FOG preceded by walking (turning or obstacles) than FOG preceded by rest (gait initiation). A freeze index (FI) was defined as the power in the `freeze' band divided by the power in the `locomotor' band (0.5\textendash 3 Hz) and a threshold chosen such that FI values above this limit were designated as FOG. A global threshold detected 78\% of FOG events and 20\% of stand events were incorrectly labeled as FOG. Individual calibration of the freeze threshold improved accuracy and sensitivity of the device to 89\% for detection of FOG with 10\% false positives. Ambulatory monitoring may significantly improve clinical management of FOG.},

However, only limited data and results have been published that demonstrate accuracy in target indications, real-world feasibility, or the validity and value of these novel approaches. Objective: This study aimed to establish accuracy, feasibility, and validity of continuous digital monitoring of walking speed in frail, elderly patients with sarcopenia and to create an open source repository of raw, derived, and reference data as a resource for the community. Methods: Data described here were collected as a part of 2 clinical studies: an independent, noninterventional validation study and a phase 2b interventional clinical trial in older adults with sarcopenia. In both studies, participants were monitored by using a waist-worn inertial sensor. The cross-sectional, independent validation study collected data at a single site from 26 naturally slow-walking elderly subjects during a parcours course through the clinic, designed to simulate a real-world environment. In the phase 2b interventional clinical trial, 217 patients with sarcopenia were recruited across 32 sites globally, where patients were monitored over 25 weeks, both during and between visits. Results: We have demonstrated that our approach can capture in-clinic gait speed in frail slow-walking adults with a residual standard error of 0.08 m per second in the independent validation study and 0.08, 0.09, and 0.07 m per second for the 4 m walk test (4mWT), 6-min walk test (6MWT), and 400 m walk test (400mWT) standard gait speed assessments, respectively, in the interventional clinical trial. We demonstrated the feasibility of our approach by capturing 9668 patient-days of real-world data from 192 patients and 32 sites, as part of the interventional clinical trial. We derived inferred contextual information describing the length of a given walking bout and uncovered positive associations between the short 4mWT gait speed assessment and gait speed in bouts between 5 and 20 steps (correlation of 0.23) and longer 6MWT and 400mWT assessments with bouts of 80 to 640 steps (correlations of 0.48 and 0.59, respectively). Conclusions: This study showed, for the first time, accurate capture of real-world gait speed in slow-walking older adults with sarcopenia. We demonstrated the feasibility of long-term digital monitoring of mobility in geriatric populations, establishing that sufficient data can be collected to allow robust monitoring of gait behaviors outside the clinic, even in the absence of feedback or incentives.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The interstitial lung diseases include a variety of disorders, many of which are characterized by fibrotic changes (fILD). Of the fILDs, Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the most common. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) frequently complicates fILD and is associated with impaired functional capability, lower physical activity, and significantly reduced life expectancy. There is no proven treatment for patients with fILD-PH. We report results from the first cohort of a phase 2b/3 trial with pulsed inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in patients with fILD-PH. METHODS: Subjects in cohort 1 were randomized to iNO 30 {$\mu$}g/kg ideal body weight/h (iNO30) or placebo for 8~weeks of blinded treatment; subjects then transitioned to open-label extension (OLE) on iNO30 followed by dose escalation to iNO45 then iNO75. Activity monitoring was used to assess changes in daily activity. Safety and efficacy were evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were randomized to iNO30 and 18 to placebo. During blinded treatment, iNO30 subjects showed an average improvement in moderate/vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and remained stable in overall activity. Placebo subjects showed an average drop of 26\%~in MVPA and a 12\%~drop in overall activity. The iNO group had an improvement in oxygen saturation. During OLE, subjects maintained their activity levels including placebo subjects who transitioned from a decline to a maintenance in all activity parameters. Inhaled nitric oxide at all doses (30, 45, and 75) was safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with iNO30 demonstrated clinically and statistically significant benefit in MVPA and clinically significant benefit in overall activity. In the OLE, higher doses of iNO were also safe and well tolerated while showing maintenance in activity parameters.},

The database has several advantages: a large number of subjects with a balanced gender ratio, variations of sensor types, sensor locations, and ground slope conditions. Therefore, we can reliably analyze the dependence of gait authentication performance on a number of factors such as gender, age group, sensor type, ground condition, and sensor location. The results with the latest existing authentication methods provide several insights for these factors.},

  abstract = {Background: Gait symptoms and balance impairment are characteristic indicators for the progression in Parkinson's disease (PD). Current gait assessments mostly focus on straight strides with assumed constant velocity, while acceleration/deceleration and turning strides are often ignored. This is either due to the set up of typical clinical assessments or technical limitations in capture volume. Wearable inertial measurement units are a promising and unobtrusive technology to overcome these limitations. Other gait phases such as initiation, termination, transitioning (between straight walking and turning) and turning might be relevant as well for the evaluation of gait and balance impairments in PD. Method: In a cohort of 119 PD patients, we applied unsupervised algorithms to find different gait clusters which potentially include the clinically relevant information from distinct gait phases in the standardized 4x10 m gait test. To clinically validate our approach, we determined the discriminative power in each gait cluster to classify between impaired and unimpaired PD patients and compared it to baseline (analyzing all straight strides). Results: As a main result, analyzing only one of the gait clusters constant, non-constant or turning led in each case to a better classification performance in comparison to the baseline (increase of area under the curve (AUC) up to 19\% relative to baseline). Furthermore, gait parameters (for turning, constant and non-constant gait) that best predict motor impairment in PD were identified. Conclusions: We conclude that a more detailed analysis in terms of different gait clusters of standardized gait tests such as the 4x10 m walk may give more insights about the clinically relevant motor impairment in PD patients.},

  title = {{Accelerometry based detection of epileptic seizures}},
  author = {Nijsen, T.M.E},

  publisher = {{Technische Universiteit Eindhoven}},
  abstract = {Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. Epileptic seizures are the manifestation of abnormal hypersynchronous discharges of cortical neurons that impair brain function. Most of the people affected can be treated successfully with drug therapy or neurosurgical procedures. But there is still a large group of epilepsy patients that continues to have frequent seizures. For these patients automated detection of epileptic seizures can be of great clinical importance. Seizure detection can influence daily care or can be used to evaluate treatment effect. Furthermore automated detection can be used to trigger an alarm system during seizures that might be harmful to the patient. This thesis focusses on accelerometry (ACM) based seizure detection. A detailed overview is provided, on the perspectives for long-term epilepsy monitoring and automated seizure detection. The value of accelerometry for seizure detection is shown by means of a clinical evaluation and the first steps are made towards automatic detection of epileptic seizures based on ACM. With accelerometers movements are recorded. A large group of epileptic seizures manifest in specific movement patterns, so called motor seizures. Chapter 2 of this thesis presents an overview of the published literature on available methods for epileptic seizure detection in a long-term monitoring context. Based on this overview recommendations are formulated that should be used in seizure detection research and development. It is shown that for seizure detection in home environments, other sensor modalities besides EEG become more important. The use of alternative sensor modalities (such as ACM) is relatively new and so is the algorithm development for seizure detection based on these measures. It was also found that for both the adaptation of existing techniques and the development of new algorithms, clinical information should be taken more into account. The value of ACM for seizure detection is shown by means of a clinical evaluation in chapter 3. Here 3-D ACM- and EEG/video-recordings of 18 patients with severe epilepsy are visually analyzed. A striking outcome presented in this chapter is the large number of visually detected seizures versus the number of seizures that was expected on forehand and the number of seizures that was observed by the nurses. These results underscore the need for an automatic seizure detection device even more, since in the current situation many seizures are missed and therefore it is possible that patients do not get the right (medical) treatment. It was also observed that 95\% of the ACM-patterns during motor seizures are sequences of three elementary patterns: myoclonic, tonic and clonic patterns. These characteristic patterns are a starting point for the development of methods for automated seizure detection based on ACM. It was decided to use a modular approach for the detection methodology and develop algorithms separately for motor activity in general, myoclonic seizures and tonic seizures. Furthermore, clinical information is incorporated in the detection methodology. Therefore in this thesis features were used that are either based on the shape of the patterns of interest as described in clinical practice (chapter 4 and 7), or the features were based on a physiological model with parameters that are related to seizure duration and intensity (chapter 5 and 6). In chapter 4 an algorithm is developed to distinguish periods with and without movement from ACM-data. Hence, when there is no movement there is no motor seizure. The amount of data that needs further analysis for seizure detection is thus reduced. From 15 ACM-signals (measured on five positions on the body), two features are computed, the variance and the jerk. In the resulting 2-D feature space a linear threshold function is used for classification. For training and testing the algorithm ACM data along with video data are used from nocturnal recordings in mentally retarded patients with severe epilepsy. Using this algorithm the amount of data that needs further analysis is reduced considerably. The results also indicate that the algorithm is robust for fluctuations across patients and thus there is no need for training the algorithm for each new patient. For the remaining data it needs to be established whether the detected movement is seizure related or not. To this purpose a model is developed for the accelerometer pattern measured on the arm during a myoclonic seizure (chapter 5). The model consists of a mechanical and an electrophysiological part. This model is used as a matched wavelet filter to detect myoclonic seizures. In chapter 6 the model based wavelet is compared to three other time frequency measures: the short time Fourier transform, the Wigner distribution and the continuous wavelet transform using a Daubechies wavelet. All four time-frequency methods are evaluated in a linear classification setup. Data from mentally retarded patients with severe epilepsy are used for training and evaluation. The results show that both wavelets are useful for detection of myoclonic seizures. On top of that, our model based wavelet has the advantage that it consists of parameters that are related to seizure duration and intensity that are physiological meaningful. Besides myoclonic seizures, the model is also useful for the detection of clonic seizures; physiologically these are repetitive myoclonic seizures. Finally for the detection of tonic seizures, in chapter 7 a set of features is studied that incorporate the mean characteristics of ACM-patterns associated with tonic seizures. Linear discriminant analysis is used for classification in the multi-dimensional feature space. For training and testing the algorithm, again data are used from recordings in mentally retarded patients with severe epilepsy. The results show that our approach is useful for the automated detection of tonic seizures based on 3-D ACM and that it is a promising contribution in a complete multi-sensor seizure detection setup.},

  abstract = {Four time-frequency and time-scale methods are studied for their ability of detecting myoclonic seizures from accelerometric data. Methods that are used are: the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), the Wigner distribution (WD), the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) using a Daubechies wavelet, and a newly introduced model-based matched wavelet transform (MOD). Real patient data are analyzed using these four timefrequency and time-scale methods. To obtain quantitative results, all four methods are evaluated in a linear classification setup. Data from 15 patients are used for training and data from 21 patients for testing. Using features based on the CWT and MOD, the success rate of the classifier was 80\%. Using STFT or WD-based features, the classification success is reduced. Analysis of the false positives revealed that they were either clonic seizures, the onset of tonic seizures, or sharp peaks in ``normal'' movements indicating that the patient was making a jerky movement. All these movements are considered clinically important to detect. Thus, the results show that both CWT and MOD are useful for the detection of myoclonic seizures. On top of that, MOD has the advantage that it consists of parameters that are related to seizure duration and intensity that are physiologically meaningful. Furthermore, in future work, the model can also be useful for the detection of other motor seizure types.},

Any study was included which reported clinical assessments in parallel with accelerometry in a free-living hospital or home setting. Study quality is reflected by participant numbers, methodological approach, technical details of the equipment used, blinding of clinical measures, whether safety and compliance data was collected. First author screened articles for inclusion and inclusion of full text articles and data extraction was confirmed by the third author. Out of 1375 initial abstracts, 8 articles were included. All participants were stroke patients. Accelerometers were worn for either 24 hours or 3 days. Data were collected as summed acceleration counts over a specified time or as the duration of active/inactive periods. Activity in both arms was reported by all studies and the ratio of impaired to unimpaired arm activity was calculated in six studies. The correlation between clinical assessments and accelerometry was tested in five studies and significant correlations were found. The efficacy of a rehabilitation intervention was assessed using accelerometry by three studies: in two studies both accelerometry and clinical test scores detected a post-treatment difference but in one study accelerometry data did not change despite clinical test scores showing motor and functional improvements. Further research is needed to understand the additional value of accelerometry as a measure of upper limb use and function in a clinical context. A simple and easily interpretable accelerometry approach is required.},

Participants were recruited from all over Norway, and lived either with their parents or in community residences with support. On average the participants generated 294 counts per minute (cpm) or 6712 steps per day, with most of the day spent in sedentary activity, 522min/day, followed by 212min/day in light PA, 71min/day in lifestyle activity and 27min/day in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Inactivity was prevalent, as only 12\% meet the current Nordic recommendations for PA. When compared, no differences for total physical activity or time in MVPA were observed between the three groups. However, participant with DS spent a mean of 73min/day less and 43min/day less in sedentary activities compared to participants with PWS and WS, respectively, (p=0.011, 95\% CI: -10.9; -80.1).

The aim of this study was to explore perceptions regarding the use of wearable technology in disease monitoring and management as reported by individuals with epilepsy and Parkinson's disease as well as health professionals working with these patient groups. Materials and Methods Six patient groups (n=25) and two groups with health professionals (n=15) participated in this qualitative, descriptive study with focus group interviews. A manifest qualitative content analysis was used. Results Four categories and nine subcategories emerged from the analysis. Participants saw possible benefits for improved treatment effect and valued this benefit more than possible inconvenience of wearing the sensors. Discrete design and simplicity were considered as facilitators for improved usability. They emphasized the importance of interactive information between patients and health professionals. However, they were concerned about unclear information and inconclusive recordings and some fears about personal integrity were at odds with the expectations on interactivity. Conclusions Patients need to feel well informed and find an added value in using wearables. Wearables need to be user-friendly, have an attractive design, and show clinical efficacy in improving disease management. Variations in perceptions regarding integrity, benefits, and effectiveness of monitoring indicate possible conflicts of expectations among participants. The engagement of end users, patients, and health professionals, in the design and implementation process, is crucial for the development of wearable devices that enhance and facilitate neurological rehabilitation practice.},

  abstract = {Background: The quantification of gait temporal parameters (i.e. step time, stance time) is crucial in human motion analysis and requires the accurate identification of gait events (i.e. heel strike, toe off). With the widespread use of inertial wearable sensors, many algorithms were proposed and applied for the purpose. Nevertheless, only few studies addressed the assessment of the actual performance of these algorithms, rather considering each proposed algorithm as a whole. Research question: How different implementation characteristics influence the assessment of gait events and temporal parameters from inertial sensor measures in terms of accuracy and repeatability? Methods: Seventeen different algorithms were identified from a systematic review and classified based on: 1) sensor position, 2) target variable, 3) computational approach. The influence of these characteristics was analysed on walking data of 35 healthy volunteers mounting 5 tri-axial inertial sensors. Foot contact events identified by 2 force platforms were assumed as gold standard. Temporal parameters were calculated from gait events. Algorithm performance was analysed in terms of accuracy (error median value) and repeatability (error 25th and 75th percentile values). Results: Shank- and foot-based algorithms performed better (in terms of accuracy and repeatability) in gait events detection and stance time estimation than lower trunk-based ones, while sensor position did not affect step estimate, given the error bias characteristics. Angular velocity-based algorithms performed significantly better than acceleration-based ones for toe off detection in terms of repeatability (68 ms and 102 ms, 25th\textendash 75th percentile error range, respectively) and, for heel strike detection, showed better repeatability (40 ms and 111 ms) and comparable accuracy (65 ms and 60 ms median error, respectively) than acceleration-based ones. The performance of different computational approaches varied depending on sensor positioning. Significance: Present results support the selection of the proper algorithm for the estimation of gait events and temporal parameters in relation to the specific application.},

  abstract = {Although the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is the ``gold-standard'' tool in assessing the severity of symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), not all activity-related disease symptoms can be accurately captured by the well-established clinical rating scale. Using an alternative approach, this study examined the level of physical activity measured by actigraphy over time and whether change in physical activity was associated with disease severity assessed by UPDRS.We used a longitudinal design in which physical activity and disease severity were assessed repeatedly during a 4-month interval, over a 3-year observational period, in a sample of 61 patients with idiopathic PD and a control group of 32 neurologically intact individuals. Physical activity data during awake-time were analyzed using the power-law exponent (PLE) method. Correlational relationships between changes in maxima values of PLE and scores of total UPDRS, UPDRS-part II (Activities of Daily Living), and UPDRS-part III (Motor Examination) in patients with PD were examined. Results show an increase in maxima values of PLE and the UPDRS total score in PD patients and that there is a positive association between changes in maxima values and total UPDRS score (r=0.746, p=0.032), UPDRS-part II score (r=0.687, p=0.027), and UPDRS-part III score (r=0.893, p=0.018). There was no significant change in the level of physical activity over time for the controls.Findings from this study indicate that change in physical activity, as captured by actigraphy, is associated with increased severity in patients' clinical symptoms of PD over time. Thus, these data suggest that, when used in conjunction with the conventional UPDRS measure, an actigraphic measure of physical activity may provide clinicians an adjunct measurement approach to monitor patients' activity-based disease progression or responses to treatment in outpatient clinic settings. \textbackslash copyright 2013 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Incessant scratching as a result of diseases such as atopic dermatitis causes skin break down, poor sleep quality, and reduced quality of life for affected individuals. In order to develop more effective therapies, there is a need for objective measures to detect scratching. Wrist actigraphy, which detects wrist movements over time using microaccelerometers, has shown great promise in detecting scratch because it is lightweight, usable in the home environment, can record longitudinally, and does not require any wires. However, current actigraphy-based scratch-detection methods are limited in their ability to discriminate scratch from other nighttime activities. Our previous work demonstrated the separability of scratch from both walking and restless sleep using a clustering technique which employed four features derived from the actigraphic data: number of accelerations above 0.01 g's, epoch variance, peak frequency, and autocorrelation value at one lag. In this paper, we extended these results by employing these same features as independent variables in a logistic regression model. This allows us to directly estimate the conditional probability of scratching for each epoch. Our approach outperforms competing actigraphy-based approaches and has both high sensitivity (0.96) and specificity (0.92) for identifying scratch as validated on experimental data collected from 12 healthy subjects. The model must still be fully validated on clinical data, but shows promise for applications to clinical trials and longitudinal studies of scratch.},

  abstract = {Smartwatches can capture continuous motor activity and physiologic metrics and could be useful for remote patient monitoring. Powers et al . developed a smartwatch-based ambulatory monitoring system to track dyskinesia and resting tremor in patients with Parkinson's disease. Smartwatch-detected tremor and dyskinesia matched clinician-reported evaluations seen during in-clinic visits. The smartwatch-based system could identify changes in symptoms resulting from better adherence to medication or deep brain stimulation treatment, as well as subclinical symptoms, suggesting a need for alternative treatment or medication titration. This study demonstrates the potential utility of smartwatch-based remote monitoring for Parkinson's disease. Longitudinal, remote monitoring of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) could enable more precise treatment decisions. We developed the Motor fluctuations Monitor for Parkinson's Disease (MM4PD), an ambulatory monitoring system that used smartwatch inertial sensors to continuously track fluctuations in resting tremor and dyskinesia. We designed and validated MM4PD in 343 participants with PD, including a longitudinal study of up to 6 months in a 225-subject cohort. MM4PD measurements correlated to clinical evaluations of tremor severity ({$\rho$} = 0.80) and mapped to expert ratings of dyskinesia presence ( P {$<$} 0.001) during in-clinic tasks. MM4PD captured symptom changes in response to treatment that matched the clinician's expectations in 94\% of evaluated subjects. In the remaining 6\% of cases, symptom data from MM4PD identified opportunities to make improvements in pharmacologic strategy. These results demonstrate the promise of MM4PD as a tool to support patient-clinician communication, medication titration, and clinical trial design.}

Trunk accelerometry is an easy, low-cost method used for balance testing and constitutes an alternative method to the posturography using force platforms. The objective was to assess the responsiveness of accelerometry in a battery of 12 quiet standing tasks. We evaluated the balance of 100 healthy adults with an accelerometer fixed onto the sternum. We used the average amplitude of acceleration as an indirect measure of postural sways. The tasks of increased difficulty were realized with or without vision. The battery of tasks was repeated four times on two different days to assess reliability. We analyzed the extent to which the task difficulty and the absence of vision affected the trunk sway. The influence of individual characteristics (age, height, mass, sex, and physical activity level) was also assessed. The reliability analysis revealed that four repetitions of the battery of tasks are needed to reach a high accuracy level (mean ICC = 0.85). The results showed that task difficulty had a very large effect on trunk sways and that the removal of vision further increased sways. Concerning the effects of individual characteristics, we observed that women tended to oscillate more than men did in tasks of low difficulty. Age and physical activity level also had significant effects, whereas height and mass did not. In conclusion, age, sex, and physical fitness are confounders that should be considered when assessing patients' balance. A battery of simple postural tasks measured by upper-trunk accelerometry can be a useful method for simple balance evaluation in clinical settings.},

Using algorithms, the walking speed can be estimated from wearable accelerometers, which enables minimally obtrusive (longitudinal) monitoring. We evaluated the performance of two algorithms, the inverted pendulum (IP) algorithm, and a novel adaptation correcting for lateral step movement, which aimed to improve accuracy during slow walking. To evaluate robustness, we gathered data from different groups (healthy adults, elderly, and elderly patients) of volunteers (n = 159) walking under various conditions (over ground, treadmill, using walking aids) at a broad range of speeds (0.11\textendash 1.93 m/s). Both of the algorithms showed good agreement with the reference values and similar root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) for walking speeds {$\geq$}0.5 m/s, which ranged from 0.09\textendash 0.16 m/s for the different positions, in line with the results from others. However, for slower walking, RMSEs were significantly better for the new method (0.06\textendash 0.09 m/s versus 0.15\textendash 0.19 m/s). Pearson correlation improved for speeds {$<$}0.5 m/s (from 0.67\textendash 0.72 to 0.73\textendash 0.82) as well as higher speeds (0.87\textendash 0.97 to 0.90\textendash 0.98) with the new method. Overall, we found that IP(-based) walking speed estimation proved to be applicable for a variety of wearing positions, conditions and speeds, indicating its potential value for health assessment applications.},

Gait regularity is typically quantified by an autocorrelation analysis of trunk/pelvis accelerations. A methodological upgrade fosters a multi-sensor approach including upper and lower limbs. Very few studies dealt with gait regularity using gyroscope data and no comparison between the two inertial sensors has been published. Therefore, this study compares gait regularity assessment by autocorrelation analyses performed on accelerometer and gyroscope data simultaneously acquired. Twenty-five adult healthy subjects walked steady-state on treadmill at three speeds (3.6, 5.0, 6.4~km/h), with rest between. Four IMUs were firmly attached on the trunk, pelvis, wrist and ankle. The autocorrelation method was applied to time-windows of the signal vector magnitude and resulted, on average for each trial, in its regularity index (RI) and periodicity index (PI), i.e. the stride time. Results showed that both sensors identified the same PI (Spearman correlation coefficient~=~0.999), and evidenced that, for matched sensor locations and gait speeds, the accelerometer-based RI was larger/equal to the gyroscope-based RI on 86.3\% of all conditions (overall median of gyroscope-to-accelerometer RI ratio was 91.1\%). The two sensors gave always statistically different RI, with the exception of the ankle at the lowest speed and wrist at higher speeds. Such results help remove potential confounders from analyses performed with different sensors and support the use of accelerometers for gait regularity assessment, not excluding that gyroscopes may be more suitable for other human movements.},

  abstract = {Walking speed is a fundamental indicator for human well-being. In a clinical setting, walking speed is typically measured by means of walking tests using different protocols. However, walking speed obtained in this way is unlikely to be representative of the conditions in a free-living environment. Recently, mobile accelerometry has opened up the possibility to extract walking speed from long-time observations in free-living individuals, but the validity of these measurements needs to be determined. In this investigation, we have developed algorithms for walking speed prediction based on 3D accelerometry data (actibeltH) and created a framework using a standardized data set with gold standard annotations to facilitate the validation and comparison of these algorithms. For this purpose 17 healthy subjects operated a newly developed mobile gold standard while walking/running on an indoor track. Subsequently, the validity of 12 candidate algorithms for walking speed prediction ranging from well-known simple approaches like combining step length with frequency to more sophisticated algorithms such as linear and non-linear models was assessed using statistical measures. As a result, a novel algorithm employing support vector regression was found to perform best with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.93 (95\%CI 0.92\textendash 0.94) and a coverage probability CP1 of 0.46 (95\%CI 0.12\textendash 0.70) for a deviation of 0.1 m/s (CP2 0.78, CP3 0.94) when compared to the mobile gold standard while walking indoors. A smaller outdoor experiment confirmed those results with even better coverage probability. We conclude that walking speed thus obtained has the potential to help establish walking speed in free-living environments as a patient-oriented outcome measure.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this guideline is to establish clinical practice recommendations for the use of actigraphy in adult and pediatric patients with suspected or diagnosed sleep disorders or circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. METHODS: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine to develop recommendations and assigned strengths based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using the GRADE process. The task force provided a summary of the relevant literature and the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that support the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations. RECOMMENDATIONS: The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians using actigraphy in evaluating patients with sleep disorders and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, and only apply to the use of FDA-approved devices. Each recommendation statement is assigned a strength (``Strong'' or ``Conditional''). A ``Strong'' recommendation (ie, ``We recommend\ldots '') is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A ``Conditional'' recommendation (ie, ``We suggest\ldots '') reflects a lower degree of certainty regarding the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific care must be made by the treating clinician and the patient, taking into consideration the individual circumstances of the patient, available treatment options, and resources. We suggest that clinicians use actigraphy to estimate sleep parameters in adult patients with insomnia disorder. (Conditional). We suggest that clinicians use actigraphy in the assessment of pediatric patients with insomnia disorder. (Conditional). We suggest that clinicians use actigraphy in the assessment of adult patients with circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder. (Conditional). We suggest that clinicians use actigraphy in the assessment of pediatric patients with circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder. (Conditional). We suggest that clinicians use actigraphy integrated with home sleep apnea test devices to estimate total sleep time during recording (in the absence of alternative objective measurements of total sleep time) in adult patients suspected of sleep-disordered breathing.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this systematic review is to provide supporting evidence for a clinical practice guideline on the use of actigraphy. METHODS: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies that compared the use of actigraphy, sleep logs, and/or polysomnography. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the clinical significance of using actigraphy as an objective measure of sleep and circadian parameters. Finally, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence for making recommendations. RESULTS: The literature search resulted in 81 studies that met inclusion criteria; all 81 studies provided data suitable for statistical analyses. These data demonstrate that actigraphy provides consistent objective data that is often unique from patient-reported sleep logs for some sleep parameters in adult and pediatric patients with suspected or diagnosed insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, sleep-disordered breathing, central disorders of hypersomnolence, and adults with insufficient sleep syndrome. These data also demonstrate that actigraphy is not a reliable measure of periodic limb movements in adult and pediatric patients. The task force provided a detailed summary of the evidence along with the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations.},

  abstract = {Walking/gait speed is a key measure for daily mobility characterization. To date, various studies have attempted to design algorithms to estimate walking speed using an inertial sensor worn on the lower back, which is considered as a proper location for activity monitoring in daily life. However, these algorithms were rarely compared and validated on the same datasets, including people with different preferred walking speed. This study implemented several original, improved, and new algorithms for estimating cadence, step length and eventually speed. We designed comprehensive cross-validation to compare the algorithms for walking slow, normal, fast, and using walking aids. We used two datasets, including reference data for algorithm validation from an instrumented mat (40 subjects) and shanks-worn inertial sensors (88 subjects), with normal and impaired walking patterns. The results showed up to 50\% performance improvements. Training of algorithms on data from people with different preferred speeds led to better performance. For the slow walkers, an average RMSE of 2.5 steps/min, 0.04 m, and 0.10 m/s were respectively achieved for cadence, step length, and speed estimation. For normal walkers, the errors were 3.5 steps/min, 0.08 m, and 0.12 m/s. An average RMSE of 1.3 steps/min, 0.05 m, and 0.10 m/s were also observed on fast walkers. For people using walking aids, the error significantly increased up to an RMSE of 14 steps/min, 0.18 m, and 0.27 m/s. The results demonstrated the robustness of the proposed combined speed estimation approach for different speed ranges. It achieved an RMSE of 0.10, 0.18, 0.15, and 0.32 m/s for slow, normal, fast, and using walking aids, respectively.},

The models were developed and tested on 20 participants (n = 10 males, n = 10 females, mean age = 24.1, mean body mass index = 23.9), who wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer on their dominant wrist and an ActiGraph GT3X on the hip while performing a variety of scripted activities. Energy expenditure was concurrently measured by a portable indirect calorimetry system. Those calibration data were then used to develop and assess both machine-learning and simpler models with fewer unknown parameters (linear regression and decision trees) to estimate metabolic equivalent scores (METs) and to classify activity intensity, sedentary time, and locomotion time. The wrist models, applied to 15-s windows, estimated METs [random forest: root mean squared error (rSME) = 1.21 METs, hip: rMSE = 1.67 METs] and activity intensity (random forest: 75\% correct, hip: 60\% correct) better than a previously developed model that used counts per minute measured at the hip. In a separate set of comparisons, the simpler decision trees classified activity intensity (random forest: 75\% correct, tree: 74\% correct), sedentary time (random forest: 96\% correct, decision tree: 97\% correct), and locomotion time (random forest: 99\% correct, decision tree: 96\% correct) nearly as well or better than the machine-learning approaches. Preliminary investigation of the models' performance on two free-living people suggests that they may work well outside of controlled conditions.},

We assessed the efficacy of nelotanserin, a selective 5-HT (2A) inverse agonist, for symptomatic treatment of RBD using systematic video analysis. Methods: This was a phase 2 multicenter study in DLB or PDD with video polysomnography (vPSG)-confirmed RBD. After a single-blind placebo run-in period, patients meeting eligibility criteria entered a 4-week double-blind treatment period (1:1 ratio with nelotanserin 80 mg/placebo). Whole-night vPSG was conducted during the run-in and at the end of the treatment period. Videos of all rapid eye movement (REM) sleep periods were analysed for RBD behaviors (movements and vocalizations) using the Innsbruck classification system by two of the central reviewers, and a third reviewer adjudicated ambiguous cases. Results: 34 patients (N = 26 DLB, N = 8 PDD; 85.3\% men; mean age 71.3 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 6.36 years) were included in the analyses. Two (5.9\%) patients were excluded due to protocol deviation in treatment compliance. Systematic video analysis demonstrated no difference between nelotanserin and placebo in RBD behaviors. Bland\textendash Altman plot showed high interrater reliability. Conclusions: Despite negative results, this is the first randomized, placebo-controlled study on symptomatic RBD treatment using objective outcome measures based on systematic video analysis. This study provides a new method for outcome research in RBD and proves that movement analysis is a feasible and meaningful outcome for studies evaluating changes in RBD severity.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a model to evaluate candidate agents to create tubal occlusion for nonsurgical permanent contraception DESIGN: Descriptive nonhuman primate study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Reproductive tracts were collected from rhesus macaques (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}10) at necropsy. Tubal patency was assessed by passing a small balloon catheter transcervically into the uterine cavity, and infusing foam until it was observed to pass freely from the fimbriae end of the fallopian tubes. The specimens were infused with 5\% polidocanol foam (PF), 3\% PF, or methylcellulose (control) foam (10mL). Following the foam infusion, the specimen was incubated at 37C in a humidity chamber for 15 min, and then a solution of 8ml of 4\% paraformaldehyde was delivered through the same catheter to rinse out the tube. The tract was then dissected to the cornua, isthmic, ampulla, and fimbriae portions and then embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic evaluation. RESULTS: Controls treated with inert methylcellulose foam displayed normal tubal epithelium. In contrast, treatment with PF led to varying degrees of epithelial cell damage progressing in severity from patchy epithelial disruption to complete epithelial exfoliation, and lumen dilation confined to the intramural zone. Mucosal damage after 5\% PF was more marked and consistent than the effect of 3\% PF. CONCLUSIONS: Transcervical perfusion of the reproductive tract PF results in acute epithelial damage to the fallopian tubes. Previous studies report that PF treatment results in permanent tubal occlusion. Effects of PF reported here represent the initial events in this process. These results support the use of ex vivo experiments to evaluate novel sclerosing agents prior to nonhuman primate in vivo experiments.},

In free-living studies, accelerometers are placed by protocol on a pre-defined body location (e.g., non-dominant wrist). However, the protocol is not always followed, e.g., the sensor can be moved between wrists or reattached in a different orientation. Such protocol violations often result in PA miscalculation. We propose an approach, PLOE (``Placement, Location and Orientation Evaluation method''), to determine the sensor position using statistical features from the raw accelerometer measurements. We compare the estimated position with the study protocol and identify discrepancies. We apply PLOE to the measurements collected from 45 older adults who wore ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers on the left and right wrist for seven days. We found that 15.6\% of participants who wore accelerometers violated the protocol for one or more days. The sensors were worn on the wrong hand during 6.9\% of the days of simultaneous wearing of devices. During the periods of discrepancies, the daily PA was miscalculated by more than 20\%. Our findings show that correct placement of the device has a significant effect on the PA estimates. These results demonstrate a need for the evaluation of sensor position.},

Researchers have proposed various human activity recognition (HAR) systems aimed at translating measurements from smartphones into various types of physical activity. In this review, we summarized the existing approaches to smartphone-based HAR. For this purpose, we systematically searched Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles published up to December 2020 on the use of smartphones for HAR. We extracted information on smartphone body location, sensors, and physical activity types studied and the data transformation techniques and classification schemes used for activity recognition. Consequently, we identified 108 articles and described the various approaches used for data acquisition, data preprocessing, feature extraction, and activity classification, identifying the most common practices, and their alternatives. We conclude that smartphones are well-suited for HAR research in the health sciences. For population-level impact, future studies should focus on improving the quality of collected data, address missing data, incorporate more diverse participants and activities, relax requirements about phone placement, provide more complete documentation on study participants, and share the source code of the implemented methods and algorithms.},

We investigated how device-based physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) and different intensity profiles were associated with all-cause mortality. We used a network harmonization approach to map dominant-wrist acceleration to PAEE in 96,476 UK Biobank participants (mean age 62 years, 56\% female). We also calculated the fraction of PAEE accumulated from moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA). Over the median 3.1-year follow-up period (302,526 person-years), 732 deaths were recorded. Higher PAEE was associated with a lower hazard of all-cause mortality for a constant fraction of MVPA (for example, 21\% (95\% confidence interval 4-35\%) lower hazard for 20 versus 15\,kJ\,kg-1\,d-1 PAEE with 10\% from MVPA). Similarly, a higher MVPA fraction was associated with a lower hazard when PAEE remained constant (for example, 30\% (8-47\%) lower hazard when 20\% versus 10\% of a fixed 15\,kJ\,kg-1\,d-1 PAEE volume was from MVPA). Our results show that higher volumes of PAEE are associated with reduced mortality rates, and achieving the same volume through higher-intensity activity is associated with greater reductions than through lower-intensity activity. The linkage of device-measured activity to energy expenditure creates a framework for using wearables for personalized prevention.},

Conversion algorithms and R2 were calculated day by day for each subject between the omnidirectional Actical and three different ActiGraph (three-dimensional) outputs: 1) vertical direction, 2) combined vector, and 3) a custom vector. Three conversion algorithms suitable for minute/minute conversions were then calculated from the full data set. Results The vertical ActiGraph activity counts demonstrated the closest relationship with the Actical, with consistent moderate to strong conversions using the algorithm: y\,=\,0.905x, in the day by day data (R2 range: 0.514 to 0.989 and average: 0.822) and full data set (R2\,=\,0.865). Conclusions The Actical is most sensitive to accelerations in the vertical direction, and does not closely correlate with three-dimensional ActiGraph output. Minute by minute conversions between the Actical and ActiGraph vertical component can be confidently performed between data sets and might allow further synthesis of information between studies.},

  abstract = {Accurate and low-cost sleep measurement tools are needed in both clinical and epidemiological research. To this end, wearable accelerometers are widely used as they are both low in price and provide reasonably accurate estimates of movement. Techniques to classify sleep from the high-resolution accelerometer data primarily rely on heuristic algorithms. In this paper, we explore the potential of detecting sleep using Random forests. Models were trained using data from three different studies where 134 adult participants (70 with sleep disorder and 64 good healthy sleepers) wore an accelerometer on their wrist during a one-night polysomnography recording in the clinic. The Random forests were able to distinguish sleep-wake states with an F1 score of 73.93\% on a previously unseen test set of 24 participants. Detecting when the accelerometer is not worn was also successful using machine learning ([Formula: see text]), and when combined with our sleep detection models on day-time data provide a sleep estimate that is correlated with self-reported habitual nap behaviour ([Formula: see text]). These Random forest models have been made open-source to aid further research. In line with literature, sleep stage classification turned out to be difficult using only accelerometer data.},

  abstract = {Accurate detection of accelerometer non-wear time is crucial for calculating physical activity summary statistics. In this study, we evaluated three epoch-based non-wear algorithms (Hecht, Troiano, and Choi) and one raw-based algorithm (Hees). In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis to provide insight into the relationship between the algorithms' hyperparameters and classification performance, as well as to generate tuned hyperparameter values to better detect episodes of wear and non-wear time. We used machine learning to construct a gold-standard dataset by combining two accelerometers and electrocardiogram recordings. The Hecht and Troiano algorithms achieved poor classification performance, while Choi exhibited moderate performance. Meanwhile, Hees outperformed all epoch-based algorithms. The sensitivity analysis and hyperparameter tuning revealed that all algorithms were able to achieve increased classification performance by employing larger intervals and windows, while more stringently defining artificial movement. These classification gains were associated with the ability to lower the false positives (type I error) and do not necessarily indicate a more accurate detection of the total non-wear time. Moreover, our results indicate that with tuned hyperparameters, epoch-based non-wear algorithms are able to perform just as well as raw-based non-wear algorithms with respect to their ability to correctly detect true wear and non-wear episodes.},

  abstract = {Objective Tracking seizures is crucial for epilepsy monitoring and treatment evaluation. Current epilepsy care relies on caretaker seizure diaries, but clinical seizure monitoring may miss seizures. Wearable devices may be better tolerated and more suitable for long-term ambulatory monitoring. This study evaluates the seizure detection performance of custom-developed machine learning (ML) algorithms across a broad spectrum of epileptic seizures utilizing wrist- and ankle-worn multisignal biosensors. Methods We enrolled patients admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit and asked them to wear a wearable sensor on either their wrists or ankles. The sensor recorded body temperature, electrodermal activity, accelerometry (ACC), and photoplethysmography, which provides blood volume pulse (BVP). We used electroencephalographic seizure onset and offset as determined by a board-certified epileptologist as a standard comparison. We trained and validated ML for two different algorithms: Algorithm 1, ML methods for developing seizure type-specific detection models for nine individual seizure types; and Algorithm 2, ML methods for building general seizure type-agnostic detection, lumping together all seizure types. Results We included 94 patients (57.4\% female, median age = 9.9 years) and 548 epileptic seizures (11 066 h of sensor data) for a total of 930 seizures and nine seizure types. Algorithm 1 detected eight of nine seizure types better than chance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC-ROC] = .648\textendash.976). Algorithm 2 detected all nine seizure types better than chance (AUC-ROC = .642\textendash.995); a fusion of ACC and BVP modalities achieved the best AUC-ROC (.752) when combining all seizure types together. Significance Automatic seizure detection using ML from multimodal wearable sensor data is feasible across a broad spectrum of epileptic seizures. Preliminary results show better than chance seizure detection. The next steps include validation of our results in larger datasets, evaluation of the detection utility tool for additional clinical seizure types, and integration of additional clinical information.},

This study evaluated an oral cannabinoid, nabilone, in the treatment of refractory human diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPN). We performed a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose study with an enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal design. DPN subjects with a pain score \$\textbackslash geq\$ 4 (0-10 scale) continued regular pain medications and were administered single-blinded adjuvant nabilone for 4 weeks. Subjects achieving \$\textbackslash geq\$ 30\% pain relief (26/37) were then randomized and treated with either flexible-dose nabilone 1-4 mg/day (n=13) or placebo (n=13) in a further 5-week double-blind treatment period, with 30\% (11/37) of subjects deemed run-in-phase nabilone nonresponders. For nabilone run-in-phase responders, there was an improvement in the change in mean end-point neuropathic pain vs placebo (mean treatment reduction of 1.27; 95\% confidence interval 2.29-0.25, P=0.02), with an average nabilone dose at end point of 2.9 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 1.1mg/day, and improvements from baseline for the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Medical Outcomes Study sleep scale problems index, and the European Quality of Life-5-Domains index score (each P{$<$}0.05). Nabilone run-in-phase responders reported greater global end-point improvement with nabilone than with placebo (100\% vs 31\%; P{$<$}0.05). Medication-related confusion led to discontinuation in 2/37 subjects during single-blind nabilone treatment. Potential unmasking occurred in 62\% of both groups. Flexible-dose nabilone 1-4 mg/day was effective in relieving DPN symptoms, improving disturbed sleep, quality of life, and overall patient status. Nabilone was well tolerated and successful as adjuvant in patients with DPN.},

From a technical perspective, the detection of left and right initial foot contacts (ICs) is essential for the computation of stride-by-stride outcome measures including gait asymmetry. However, in a majority of studies only one sensor close to the center of mass is used, complicating the assignment of detected ICs to the respective foot. Therefore, we developed an algorithm including supervised machine learning (ML) models for the robust classification of left and right ICs using multiple features from the gyroscope located at the lower back. The approach was tested on a data set including 40 participants (ten healthy controls, ten hemiparetic, ten Parkinson's disease, and ten Huntington's disease patients) and reached an accuracy of 96.3\% for the overall data set and up to 100.0\% for the Parkinson's sub data set. These results were compared to a state-of-the-art algorithm. The ML approaches outperformed this traditional algorithm in all subgroups. Our study contributes to an improved classification of left and right ICs in inertial sensor signals recorded at the lower back and thus enables a reliable computation of clinically relevant mobility measures.},

As currently available systems focus on tonic\textendash clonic seizures, we want to detect a broader range of seizure types, including tonic, hypermotor, and clusters of seizures. Methods In this multicenter, prospective cohort study, the nonelectroencephalographic (non-EEG) signals heart rate and accelerometry were measured during the night in patients undergoing a diagnostic video-EEG examination. Based on clinical video-EEG data, seizures were classified and categorized as clinically urgent or not. Seizures included for analysis were tonic, tonic\textendash clonic, hypermotor, and clusters of short myoclonic/tonic seizures. Features reflecting physiological changes in heart rate and movement were extracted. Detection algorithms were developed based on stepwise fulfillment of conditions during increases in either feature. A training set was used for development of algorithms, and an independent test set was used for assessing performance. Results Ninety-five patients were included, but due to sensor failures, data from only 43 (of whom 23 patients had 86 seizures, representing 402 h of data) could be used for analysis. The algorithms yield acceptable sensitivities, especially for clinically urgent seizures (sensitivity = 71\textendash 87\%), but produce high false alarm rates (2.3\textendash 5.7 per night, positive predictive value = 25\textendash 43\%). There was a large variation in the number of false alarms per patient. Significance It seems feasible to develop a detector with high sensitivity, but false alarm rates are too high for use in clinical practice. For further optimization, personalization of algorithms may be necessary.},

  abstract = {Background The extensive heterogeneity between patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) complicates the quanti-fication of disease progression. In this study, we determine the value of remote, accelerometer-based monitoring of physical activity in patients with ALS. Methods This longitudinal cohort study was conducted in a home-based setting; all study materials were sent by mail. Patients wore the ActiGraph during waking hours for 7 days every 2-3 months and provided information regarding their daily functioning (ALSFRS-R). We defined four accelerometer-based endpoints that either reflect the average daily activity or quantify the patient's physical capacity. Results A total of 42 patients participated; the total valid monitoring period was 9288 h with a 93.0\% adherence rate. At baseline, patients were active 27.9\% (range 11.6-52.4\%) of their time; this declined by 0.64\% (95\% 0.43-0.86, p {$<$} 0.001) per month. Accelerometer-based endpoints were strongly associated with the ALSFRS-R (r 0.78, 95\% CI 0.63-0.92, p {$<$} 0.001), but showed less variability over time than the ALSFRS-R (coefficient of variation 0.64-0.81 vs. 1.06, respectively). Accel-erometer-based endpoints could reduce sample size by 30.3\% for 12-month trials and 44.6\% for 18-month trials; for trials lasting less than 9 months, the ALSFRS-R resulted in smaller sample sizes. Conclusion Accelerometry is an objective method for quantifying disease progression, which could obtain real-world insights in the patient's physical functioning and may personalize the delivery of care. In addition, remote monitoring provides patients with the opportunity to participate in clinical trials from home, paving the way to a patient-centric clinical trial model.},

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and SportDiscus, using 'exercise', 'physical activity', 'motor activity' and 'questionnaire' as keywords. We included studies that evaluated the measurement properties of self-report questionnaires assessing PA. Article selection, data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. The quality and results of the studies were evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Physical Activity Questionnaires (QAPAQ) checklist. Construct validity, reliability and responsiveness were rated as positive, negative or indeterminate, depending on the methods and results. We included 85 (versions of) questionnaires. Overall, the quality of the studies assessing measurement properties of PA questionnaires was rather poor. Information on content validity was mostly lacking. Construct validity was assessed in 76 of the questionnaires, mostly by correlations with accelerometer data, maximal oxygen uptake or activity diaries. Fifty-one questionnaires were tested for reliability. Only a few questionnaires had sufficient construct validity and reliability, but these need to be further validated. Responsiveness was studied for only two questionnaires and was poor. There is a clear lack of standardization of PA questionnaires, resulting in many variations of questionnaires. No questionnaire or type of questionnaire for assessing PA was superior and therefore could not be strongly recommended above others. In the future, more attention should be paid to the methodology of studies assessing measurement properties of PA questionnaires and the quality of reporting.},

  abstract = {Objective and accurate activity identification of physical activities in everyday life is an important aspect in assessing the impact of various post-stroke rehabilitation therapies and interventions. Since post-stroke hemiparesis affects gait and balance in individuals with stroke, activity identification algorithms that consider stroke-specific movement irregularities are needed. While wearable physical activity monitors provide the means to detect activities in the free-living, algorithms using their data are specific to the wear location of the device. This pilot study builds, validates, and compares three machine learning algorithms (linear support vector machine, Random Forest, and RUSBoosted trees) at three popular wear locations (wrist, waist, and ankle) to identify and accurately distinguish mobility-related activities (sitting, standing and walking) in individuals with chronic stroke. A total of 102 minutes of data from two lab visits of three-stroke participants was used to build the classifiers. A 5-fold cross-validation technique was used to validate and compare the accuracy of classifiers. RUSBoosted trees using data from waist and ankle activity monitors, with an accuracy of 99.1\%, outperformed other classifiers in detecting three activities of interest.},

  abstract = {Objective: The application of wearable devices in individuals with acquired brain injury (ABI) resulting from stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI) for monitoring physical activity (PA) has been relatively recent. The current systematic review aims to provide insights into the adaption of these devices, the outcome metrics, and their transition from the laboratory to the community for PA monitoring of individuals with ABI. Literature Survey: The PubMed and Google Scholar databases were systematically reviewed using appropriate search terms. A total of 20 articles were reviewed from the last 15 years. Methodology: Articles were classified into three categories: PA measurement studies, PA classification studies, and validation studies. The quality of studies was assessed using a quality appraisal checklist. Synthesis: It was found that the transition of wearable devices from in-lab to community-based studies in individuals with stroke has started but is not widespread. The transition of wearable devices in the community has not yet started for individuals with TBI. Accelerometer-based devices were more frequently chosen than pedometers and inertial measurement units. No consensus on a preferred wearable device (make or model) or wear location could be identified, although step count was the most common outcome metric. The accuracy and validity of most outcome metrics used in the community were not reported for many studies. Conclusions: To facilitate future studies using wearable devices for PA measurement in the community, we recommend that researchers provide details on the accuracy and validity of the outcome metrics specific to the study environment. Once the accuracy and validity are established for a specific population, wearable devices and their derived outcomes can provide objective information on mobility impairment as well as the effect of rehabilitation in the community.},

  abstract = {Purpose Clinical management of epilepsy and current epilepsy therapy trials rely on paper or electronic diaries often with inaccurate self-reported seizure frequency as the primary outcome. This is the first study addressing the feasibility of detecting and recording generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) through a biosensor linked to an online seizure database. Method A prospective trial was conducted with video-EEG (vEEG) in an epilepsy monitoring unit. Patients wore a wristwatch accelerometer that detected shaking and transmitted events via Bluetooth\textregistered{} to a bedside electronic tablet and then via Wi-Fi to an online portal. The watch recorded the date, time, audio, duration, frequency and amplitude of events. Events logged by the watch and recorded in a bedside paper diary were measured against vEEG, the ``gold standard.'' Results Thirty patients were enrolled and 62 seizures were recorded on vEEG: 31 convulsive and 31 non-convulsive. Twelve patients had a total of 31 convulsive seizures, and of those, 10 patients had 13 GTCS. The watch captured 12/13 (92.3\%) GTCS. Watch audio recordings were consistent with seizures in 11/12 (91.6\%). Data were successfully transferred to the bedside tablet in 11/12 (91.6\%), and to the online database in 10/12 (83.3\%) GTCS. The watch recorded 81 false positives, of which 42/81 (51\%) were cancelled by the patients. Patients and caregivers verbally reported 15/62 seizures (24.2\% sensitivity) but no seizures were recorded on paper logs. Conclusion Automatic detection and recording of GTCS to an online database is feasible and may be more informative than seizure logging in a paper diary.},

  abstract = {ImportanceImpaired sleep and alertness are some of the most common nonmotor manifestations of Parkinson disease (PD) and currently have only limited treatment options. Light therapy (LT), a widely available treatment modality in sleep medicine, has not been systematically studied in the PD population.ObjectiveTo determine the safety and efficacy of LT on excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with PD.Design, Settings, and ParticipantsThis randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical intervention study was set in PD centers at Northwestern University and Rush University. Participants were 31 patients with PD receiving stable dopaminergic therapy with coexistent EDS, as assessed by an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 12 or greater, and without cognitive impairment or primary sleep disorder. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive bright LT or dim-red LT (controlled condition) twice daily in 1-hour intervals for 14 days. This trial was conducted between March 1, 2007, and October 31, 2012. Data analysis of the intention-to-treat population was conducted from November 1, 2012, through April 30, 2016.Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome measure was the change in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score comparing the bright LT with the dim-red LT. Secondary outcome measures included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score, the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale score, the visual analog scale score for daytime sleepiness, and sleep log\textendash derived and actigraphy-derived metrics.ResultsAmong the 31 patients (13 males and 18 females; mean [SD] disease duration, 5.9 [3.6] years), bright LT resulted in significant improvements in EDS, as assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (mean [SD], 15.81 [3.10] at baseline vs 11.19 [3.31] after the intervention). Both bright LT and dim-red LT were associated with improvements in sleep quality as captured by mean (SD) scores on the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (7.88 [4.11] at baseline vs 6.25 [4.27] after bright LT, and 8.87 [2.83] at baseline vs 7.33 [3.52] after dim-red LT) and the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (97.24 [22.49] at baseline vs 106.98 [19.37] after bright LT, and 95.11 [19.86] at baseline vs 99.28 [16.94] after dim-red LT). Bright LT improved several self-reported mean (SD) sleep metrics, including sleep fragmentation (number of overnight awakenings, 1.51 [1.03] at baseline vs 0.92 [0.97] after the intervention), sleep quality (sleep diary score, 3.03 [1.01] at baseline vs 3.53 [0.91] after the intervention), and ease of falling asleep (sleep diary score, 2.32 [0.89] at baseline vs 1.83 [0.88] after the intervention). Light therapy was associated with increased daily physical activity as assessed by actigraphy (average activity [SD] counts, 165.01 [66.87] at baseline vs 194.59 [87.81] after the intervention).Conclusions and RelevanceLight therapy was well tolerated and may be a feasible intervention for improving the sleep-wake cycles in patients with PD.

The psychology of the epilepsy patient penalizes the use of user-driven modeling, which means that the probability of identifying convulsions is driven through generalized models. Focusing on clonic convulsions, this pre-clinical study proposes a method for generating a type of model that can evaluate the generalization capabilities. A realistic experimentation with healthy participants is performed, each with a single 3D accelerometer placed on the most affected wrist. Unlike similar studies reported in the literature, this proposal makes use of [Formula: see text] cross-validation scheme, in order to evaluate the generalization capabilities of the models. Event-based error measurements are proposed instead of classification-error measurements, to evaluate the generalization capabilities of the model, and Fuzzy Systems are proposed as the generalization modeling technique. Using this method, the experimentation compares the most common solutions in the literature, such as Support Vector Machines, [Formula: see text]-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees and Fuzzy Systems. The event-based error measurement system records the results, penalizing those models that raise false alarms. The results showed the good generalization capabilities of Fuzzy Systems.},

Our objectives were therefore to i) identify distinct PA profiles in people with PD based on accelerometer data, ii) explore differences between the profiles regarding personal characteristics and physical function. Accelerometer data from 301 participants (43\% women, mean age: 71 years) was analysed using latent profile analyses of 15 derived PA variables. Physical function measurements included balance performance, comfortable gait speed and single and dual-task functional mobility. Three distinct profiles were identified; ``Sedentary'' (N = 68), ``Light Movers'' (N = 115), ``Steady Movers'' (N = 118). ``Sedentary'' included people with PD with high absolute and relative time spent in Sedentary behaviour (SB), little time light intensity physical activity (LIPA) and negligible moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). ``Light Movers'' were people with PD with values close to the mean for all activity variables. ``Steady Movers'' spent less time in SB during midday, and more time in LIPA and MVPA throughout the day, compared to the other profiles. ``Sedentary'' people had poorer balance (P = 0.006), poorer functional mobility (P = 0.027) and were more likely to have fallen previously (P = 0.027), compared to ``Light Movers. The Timed Up and Go test, an easily performed clinical test of functional mobility, was the only test that could distinguish between all three profiles. Distinct PA profiles, with clear differences in how the time awake is spent exist among people with mild-moderate PD.},

We systematically reviewed extant evidence until September 2018 pertaining to actigraphy use in schizophrenia, its clinical/biological correlates and posit future research directions. Within 38 included studies involving 2700 subjects, patients with schizophrenia generally have lower motor activity levels, poorer sleep quality and efficiency, increased sleep fragmentation and duration compared with healthy controls. Lowered motor activity and longer sleep duration in patients were associated with greater severity of negative symptoms. Less structured motor activity and decreased sleep quality were associated with greater severity of positive symptoms, worse cognitive functioning involving attention and processing speed, illness chronicity, higher antipsychotic dose, and poorer quality of life. Correlations of actigraphic measures with biological factors are sparse with inconclusive results. Future studies with larger sample sets may adopt a multimodal, longitudinal approach which examines both motor and sleep activity, triangulates clinical, actigraphic and biological measures to clarify their inter-relationships and inform risk prediction of illness onset, course, and treatment response over time.},

Freedson cutpoints (counts/min) were used to define sedentary ({$<$}100), light (100\textendash 1951), moderate (1952\textendash 5724), and vigorous activity ({$\geq$}5725). Agreement was evaluated using paired difference tests, intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots. Given systematic differences in count-based estimates between monitors, a calibration formula applied to the wGT3X-BT values was obtained by linear regression. Results Total detected wear time min/day was nearly identical between the 7164 and wGT3X-BT (881.5{$\pm$}70.9 vs. 880.3{$\pm$}78.1, p=0.72).

A significant difference was observed for vigorous min/day (0.2{$\pm$}1.0 vs. 0.0{$\pm$}0.3, p{$<$}0.01); however, the absolute difference was marginal. Intraclass correlation coefficients showed excellent agreement for all measures (ICC=0.95\textendash 0.99). Conclusion After applying a calibration formula, the 7164 and wGT3X-BT were comparable for total wear time, count-based estimates, and average min/day in sedentary, light, moderate, and moderate to vigorous activity.

Devices to quantify itch objectively primarily use scratch as a proxy. This review compares and evaluates the performance of technologies aimed at objectively measuring scratch behavior. Methods Articles identified from literature searches performed in October 2020 were reviewed and those that did not report a primary statistical performance measure (eg, sensitivity, specificity) were excluded. The articles were independently reviewed by 2 authors. Results The literature search resulted in 6231 articles, of which 24 met eligibility criteria. Studies were categorized by technology, with actigraphy being the most studied (n~=~21). Wrist actigraphy's performance is poorer in pruritic patients and inherently limited in finger-dominant scratch detection. It has moderate correlations with objective measures (Eczema and Area Severity Index/Investigator's Global Assessment: rs({$\rho$})~=~0.70-0.76), but correlations with subjective measures are poor (r2~=~0.06, rs({$\rho$})~=~0.18-0.40 for itch measured using a visual analog scale). This may be due to varied subjective perception of itch or actigraphy's underestimation of scratch. Conclusion Actigraphy's large variability in performance and limited understanding of its specificity for scratch merits larger studies looking at validation of data analysis algorithms and device performance, particularly within target patient populations.},

  abstract = {Walking speed is widely used to study human health status. Wearable inertial measurement units (IMU) are promising tools for the ambulatory measurement of walking speed. Among wearable inertial sensors, the ones worn on the wrist, such as a watch or band, have relatively higher potential to be easily incorporated into daily lifestyle. Using the arm swing motion in walking, this paper proposes a regression model-based method for longitudinal walking speed estimation using a wrist-worn IMU. A novel kinematic variable is proposed, which finds the wrist acceleration in the principal axis (i.e. the direction of the arm swing). This variable (called pca-acc) is obtained by applying sensor fusion on IMU data to find the orientation followed by the use of principal component analysis. An experimental evaluation was performed on 15 healthy young subjects during free walking trials. The experimental results show that the use of the proposed pca-acc variable can significantly improve the walking speed estimation accuracy when compared to the use of raw acceleration information (p{$<$}0.01). When Gaussian process regression is used, the resulting walking speed estimation accuracy and precision is about 5.9\% and 4.7\%, respectively.},
